          title: "Research Philosophy",
          content: `This section elaborates on the ontological and epistemological assumptions that underpin this study. From an ontological perspective, the research assumed a constructionist stance, meaning that reality is socially constructed and subjective, shaped by the experiences and interactions of individuals, as well as context (Bell et al., 2022). This stance suits the topic, acknowledging that AI use is shaped by personal experiences and evolving interpretations, not a single objective reality.

In terms of epistemology, this study adopted an interpretivist philosophy, which emphasizes the subjective nature of reality and acknowledges that knowledge is gained through understanding how people make meaning of their experiences (Ryan, 2018). This approach aligned well with the study's aims, given that entrepreneurs' perceived benefits and weaknesses of AI integration in the DT process are shaped by the individuality of their experiences and therefore not measurable. This perspective allowed for capturing nuanced, subjective insights rather than seeking universal truths.`

          title: "Research Type",
          content: `Aligned with the research philosophy, this study followed a qualitative, abductive and exploratory research approach. A qualitative approach is suited to understanding complex, context-dependent phenomena, particularly where subjective meaning and interpretation are central (Azungah, 2018). Given the limited prior research on the topic, the study seeked to build understanding from the ground up, which is characteristic of an inductive approach (Azungah, 2018). Furthermore, the research was exploratory in nature and abductive, aiming to uncover patterns, themes, and insights related to the rapidly evolving field of AI, particularly in its application to DT practices (Swedberg, 2020) and mapping onto the DT stages. This approach allowed the study to remain open to new findings and adapt if unexpected insights were to emerge (Swedberg, 2020).`

          content: `Since this study aims to build an understanding of how entrepreneurs integrate AI into the DT process by gathering qualitative data, the Gioia method was used to structure the findings that later led to findings (Gioia et al., 2013). By collecting data from real-world applications, findings were deeply rooted in practical experiences, and hypotheses and theories related to the benefits, limitations, and adaptations involved in using AI within early-stage venture development can be constructed. Data collection and analysis occurred iteratively, meaning that emerging themes shaped subsequent interviews.`

          title: "Sampling Strategy",
          content: `To address the research question, this study applied a non-probability sampling strategy aligned with a qualitative, abductive approach. The primary goal was to gather in-depth, nuanced insights from individuals with relevant, first-hand experience using AI for DT activities in entrepreneurship.

Nine participants were selected based on purposive criteria to ensure relevance to the research topic. No new emerging themes appeared in the later stages of data collection, suggesting that thematic saturation had been reached and earlier findings were consistently reinforced. Inclusion criteria required participants to, at the time of participation:

• Be directly involved in decision-making within an early-stage venture (e.g., founder, venture builder, product lead, innovation strategist);
• Be directly involved in any activities that align with one or more stages of the DT process (e.g., user research, ideation, prototyping, testing);
• Have practical experience with AI tools (such as ChatGPT, image generators, or other generative technologies);
• Be able to reflect on their use of AI after the widespread availability of such tools in late 2022.

Participants were not required to explicitly label their process as "Design Thinking," but their involvement had to demonstrate alignment with its principles through specific activities they carried out in their venture work.`

          title: "Data Collection Method",
          content: `This study collected data through nine semi-structured interviews, a method well-suited to qualitative research focused on understanding views, experiences, beliefs and motivations of individual participants (Kallio et al., 2016). This format allowed for consistency across interviews while still enabling participants to express themselves freely and share unique insights into the research topic. The open-ended nature of the questions allowed for flexibility on the part of the interviewer and interviewee, while the structured elements allowed for comparisons to be made between respondents and patterns to be identified.

All interviews were conducted online via video call and were initially scheduled for one hour. In practice, they typically lasted between 55 and 75 minutes, depending on the depth of the participant's answers, with one exception that lasted 45 minutes. This data was collected during April and May of 2025. Interviews were audio-recorded with participant permission and later transcribed verbatim.`

          title: "Data Analysis Technique",
          content: `The data collected in this study was analyzed using the Gioia methodology, a systematic approach to inductive research that emphasizes thoroughness and traceability (Gioia et al., 2013).

The analysis was done in three main stages. First, during the first-order coding phase, each interview transcript was reviewed in full and relevant quotations were highlighted based on their connection to the research question. Each of these quotes was then assigned a first-order code using the researchers' own words, forming a shortened version that still reflected the participant's meaning as closely as possible. If a quote related to a specific stage of the DT process (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, or Test), that stage was also labeled explicitly alongside the corresponding code. For each interview, between 15 and 55 first-order codes were created, resulting in a total of 298 first-order codes across all nine interviews.

In the second-order coding phase, all first-order codes were compared and clustered into a total of 17 second-order themes. This step involved identifying patterns, differences, and underlying meanings across interviews. The themes were developed inductively, but informed by the study's research question.

Finally, in the third stage, the second-order themes were grouped into five aggregate dimensions based on their conceptual similarity or alignment. These aggregate dimensions served to structure the findings and represented the core constructs that answer the research question.`

      id: "limitations",
      title: "3.3 Limitations",
      content: `This research had several methodological limitations that should be acknowledged. One key limitation concerns the generalizability of the findings. Because the study used a non-probability sampling approach, participants were selected based on their relevance to the research question rather than representativeness of a broader population. This sampling approach also introduced selection bias, as the researchers' judgment influenced who was considered suitable. The reliance on existing networks may have further narrowed the range of perspectives included. While efforts were made to ensure diversity across age, industry, and geography, the small sample size also limits claims of theoretical saturation.

The semi-structured interview format, while offering both depth and flexibility, may have also led to inconsistencies across interviews. Some questions were only asked when relevant to the natural flow of the conversation, which may have affected comparability. Additionally, there is a potential for observer bias if certain interviewer phrasing influenced participant responses, despite efforts to maintain neutrality.

Lastly, the study relied solely on interviews. While appropriate for an exploratory abductive approach, the absence of triangulation with other data sources (e.g. case studies) made it difficult to validate findings from multiple perspectives. Nonetheless, these limitations are acknowledged to ensure transparency and support the study's credibility.`

      title: "3.4 Ethical Considerations",
      content: `This study was designed and conducted following established ethical standards for qualitative research involving human participants. All participants were informed of the purpose of the study, the voluntary nature of their participation, the use of audio recordings, and the intended use of their data prior to the start of each interview. Verbal consent was obtained.

To protect participant privacy, all data was anonymized during transcription and analysis. Names and identifying details were removed, and each participant was assigned a pseudonym. The anonymized data was stored securely and only accessible to the researchers involved in this study. Participants were informed that they could withdraw their consent at any time and request the removal of their data.

The data collection and analysis procedures were carefully designed to minimize ethical risks such as social desirability bias or interviewer influence and ensure that findings emerged solely from the collected material. This was done by framing questions openly and avoiding judgmental language when creating the interview guide.`

      title: "3.5 Trustworthiness of the Study",
      content: `To ensure the trustworthiness of this research, the criteria proposed by Lincoln and Guba (1985) were applied: credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability. Credibility was strengthened through triangulation, using diverse participant perspectives and cross-checking codes between two independent researchers. Transferability was supported through thick description, offering enough contextual detail for readers to assess the applicability of findings to other settings. Dependability was addressed through a clear, iterative process with systematic coding and thorough documentation of methodological decisions. Confirmability was also strengthened by documenting choices, as well as through reflexivity, remaining aware of how researcher bias may have influenced data collection and interpretation, while grounding all findings in participant accounts. These measures collectively enhanced the study's overall trustworthiness and support future research in this field.`
