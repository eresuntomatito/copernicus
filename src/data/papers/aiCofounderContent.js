  executiveSummary: {
    overview: "This groundbreaking master's thesis investigates how artificial intelligence is transforming Design Thinking in entrepreneurial ventures. Through nine semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs actively integrating AI into their workflows, the research reveals that AI significantly accelerates and scales all five Design Thinking stages—from user research and problem framing to ideation, prototyping, and testing. However, this acceleration comes with critical limitations: AI-generated outputs often lack novelty and depth, reliability concerns persist, and over-reliance creates new dependencies. The study finds that successful AI integration requires entrepreneurs to develop AI literacy, create custom workflows, and maintain strategic human oversight. A key insight is the evolving dynamic of human-AI collaboration, where human roles shift between participatory (Empathize, Ideate, Test) and supervisory (Define, Prototype) depending on the Design Thinking stage.",
    keyPoints: [
      "AI reduces research time from weeks to days, prototype development by 75%, and scales ideation dramatically—but speed gains don't reduce workload, just enable more iterations",
      "AI lacks true creativity and produces generic ideas; entrepreneurs must curate outputs, inject originality, and maintain human judgment for strategic decisions",
      "Entrepreneurs trust AI 0% for critical decisions and emphasize 'human-in-the-loop' oversight; AI-generated code often breaks, requiring technical expertise to refine",
      "Successful AI integration demands continuous learning, prompt engineering skills, and custom workflows; entrepreneurs face a steep learning curve in an overwhelming tool landscape",
      "AI simultaneously empowers (50% income increases reported) and creates dependency, intensifies competition, and transforms team structures while demanding new entrepreneurial capabilities"

## The Provocative Question

As artificial intelligence reshapes industries, a provocative question emerges for entrepreneurs: **"Can AI serve as a co-founder in modern entrepreneurship?"** This thesis investigates how AI interacts with and transforms the Design Thinking (DT) process in entrepreneurial contexts.

### The ChatGPT Moment

The Fourth Industrial Revolution saw a pivotal acceleration with OpenAI's ChatGPT launch in November 2022. This free, web-based AI chatbot marked the beginning of mainstream AI integration into everyday life, reaching **400 million active weekly users** by February 2025. Generative AI democratized artificial intelligence, transforming it from complex algorithms accessible only to experts into an everyday tool.

### Why This Matters Now

> "AI can act as a guiding coach to the entrepreneur, helping to build and quickly validate businesses."

Design Thinking has become widely adopted in business creation, offering a framework to tackle uncertainty and problem-solving. With roots in human-centered innovation, DT emphasizes practical problem-solving through iterative experimentation—making it ideal for AI integration.

### The Research Question

**How does artificial intelligence affect the activities involved in the design thinking process in entrepreneurship, and what challenges and strategies emerge in its practical application?**

### Study Design

- **9 semi-structured interviews** with entrepreneurial design thinkers
- **Active AI users** in early-stage ventures
- **Qualitative analysis** using the Gioia methodology
- **Timeframe**: April-May 2025 (post-ChatGPT era)

### The Stakes

If new ventures effectively integrate AI as a core component, they will be at the forefront of innovation. But will AI truly act as a co-founder, or does it serve a different role entirely?

## Dramatic Speed and Scale Improvements

One of the most striking findings: **AI dramatically accelerates every stage of Design Thinking.** But this speed comes with important nuances.

### Empathize: From Weeks to Days

**Before AI:**
- 2 weeks to interview 10 people
- Manual review analysis
- Limited data processing capacity

**With AI:**
> "Now, in one day, I can get 100 or 150 interviews." — Sofia, AI Startup Founder

AI enables processing "tens of thousands of data points within minutes" through automated sentiment analysis, review scraping, and deep research capabilities.

### Define: Rapid Insight Synthesis

Tasks that once took "a good three days" are now completed in hours. AI clusters insights, detects patterns, and summarizes findings from large volumes of research data.

### Ideate: Volume and Breadth

Prompt chains speed up ideation dramatically—generating ideas in hours vs. months. AI is "mostly increasing speed and efficiency right now," allowing entrepreneurs to explore wider solution spaces.

### Prototype: The 99% Cost Reduction

This stage shows the most dramatic impact:

**Digital Prototyping Transformations:**
- Development time reduced to **"a quarter of what it was"**
- Projects that cost **€200,000 and took 2 months** now cost **€200 in 2 weeks**
- **70% of coding work** done by AI
- 5-month projects compressed to **2 months**

> "Build products in two weeks, then drop them onto the market." — Johan, Tech Entrepreneur

**The Trade-off:**
> "Speed has increased, but stability has decreased." — Magnus

AI-generated code often requires significant debugging and refinement. Physical prototyping sees less impact than digital.

### Test: MVP-Based Validation

Higher quality prototypes enable better feedback loops. Entrepreneurs can test features quickly and iteratively, getting real market validation instead of "philosophizing" about hypothetical products.

### The Paradox

**Faster doesn't mean less busy.** Despite dramatic time savings, entrepreneurs report being "super busy" because they can now do more iterations. Speed enables scale, but workload remains intense.

**Key Insight:** AI accelerates execution, but strategic thinking and quality still require human depth.

      content: `
## AI Inspires But Doesn't Innovate

AI's impact on creativity reveals a fascinating paradox: it can jumpstart thinking but rarely produces genuinely novel ideas.

### The Positive: Creative Companion

**Blind Spot Detection:**
> "AI makes you think about things you did not think about." — Sofia

Entrepreneurs use AI to explore alternative perspectives:
- **Prompt technique**: "Choose the opposing side and give me three ideas from that perspective"
- Acts as creative jumpstarter when you have a partial idea
- Extends thinking to "generate additional ideas"
- Uncovers assumptions you didn't realize you were making

**Use Case Example:**
Martin uses AI to challenge his assumptions by asking it to argue the opposite position, revealing blind spots in his strategic thinking.

### The Negative: Generic Output

**Limited Novelty:**
> "AI tends to always generate similar ideas." — Sofia

> "Not very good at generating business ideas." — Daniel

The core problem: AI lacks out-of-the-box thinking and produces obvious, surface-level suggestions.

**Why This Happens:**
- AI is trained on existing patterns and data
- Cannot escape its training boundaries
- Lacks contextual richness and cultural nuance
- Missing the "bold" factor that defines breakthrough innovation

**The Expert View:**
> "Our own brains are a lot better in finding a real solution to a real problem than the AI is." — Martin

### The Right Use of AI in Ideation

**Do:**
- ✅ Use AI to **trigger your thought process**
- ✅ Ask it to **challenge your assumptions**
- ✅ Generate **alternatives to explore**
- ✅ Use as a **sparring partner** for refinement

**Don't:**
- ❌ Accept AI's first suggestions as final
- ❌ Let AI generate your core business idea
- ❌ Rely on AI for breakthrough innovation
- ❌ Use AI-generated ideas without human curation

### The Human Role

Ideas should emerge from **problem identification**, not AI generation. The entrepreneur must:
- Curate and combine AI outputs
- Inject cultural relevance and context
- Add boldness and risk-taking
- Apply gut feeling and experience

**Bottom Line:** AI extends ideation breadth, but humans provide ideation depth and originality.

      title: 'Finding 3: Trust, Quality, and Oversight',
      content: `
## The Zero-Trust Reality

Perhaps the most striking finding: **Entrepreneurs trust AI 0% for critical decisions.** Despite widespread AI adoption, maintaining human oversight is non-negotiable.

### Human-in-the-Loop: The Rule, Not the Exception

**Strategic Decisions:**
> "I trust it for 0% of any decision. I don't think AI will ever make business decisions." — Martin

> "Everything that is being output by AI is human approved." — Oliver

**Customer Validation:**
> "We still talk to real people and double check." — Frank

> "You need to test with humans—AI can't replace real user interaction." — Sofia

**The Pattern:**
- Final decisions "prioritized based on our **gut feeling and experience**"
- AI used only to "fine-tune ideas" or "trigger thought process"
- Human judgment remains the ultimate arbiter

### Technical Oversight Requirements

**Code Quality Issues:**
> "The actual code that AI writes is oftentimes **breaking more than it is not**." — Oliver

> "You need some sort of technical knowledge to go into the code and program it further." — Frank

> "You still need proper coders to refine to high standards." — Viktor

**The Reality:**
- 70% of code may be AI-generated, but 100% requires human review
- Technical expertise essential for production quality
- AI creates first draft; humans ensure stability and performance

### The Black Box Problem

**Transparency Concerns:**
> "If it starts evaluating the idea: what are you evaluating it based on?" — Frank

> "You can't trust an answer most of the time." — Johan

**Key Issues:**
- Unclear reasoning behind outputs
- Especially problematic for legal/financial advice
- Potential for biased algorithms
- Accountability unclear when things go wrong

**Mitigation Strategy:**
Better prompting skills can improve output reliability, but fundamental transparency limitations remain.

### The Supervisory vs. Participatory Model

**Different Stages Require Different Oversight:**

**Participatory (Direct Engagement):**
- **Empathize**: Must engage with real users to validate insights
- **Ideate**: Active curation and combination of AI outputs
- **Test**: Direct user testing cannot be automated

**Supervisory (Monitoring & Refinement):**
- **Define**: Interpret AI-synthesized insights, frame the right problem
- **Prototype**: Guide functionality, ensure quality and stability

### The Bottom Line

AI is not a "co-founder" because it **doesn't have skin in the game**. It's more accurately a "consultant," "first employee," or "junior team member"—valuable but requiring constant direction and verification.

**Trust is earned through oversight, not automation.**

## The Learning Curve Challenge

Successful AI integration isn't automatic—it requires significant skill development and strategic adaptation.

### The Steep Learning Curve

**Constant Evolution:**
> "Constantly having to learn something new every five minutes." — Erik

> "You need to play around and learn—trial and error is essential." — Sofia

**The Urgency:**
> "If you don't get used to using AI, you're going to be left behind." — Sofia

**The Reality:**
Continuous learning is required due to rapid tool evolution. This isn't a one-time training—it's an ongoing commitment.

### The Tool Overload Problem

**Abundance Without Mastery:**
> "Everyone says they use it but when it comes to doing it they don't really know." — Martin

> "A very much wild-west world now… Everyone still tries to understand the limits." — Daniel

**The Challenge:**
- Overwhelming number of AI tools available
- Difficulty extracting meaningful value
- Gap between availability and effective application
- Tool saturation leads to underutilization

**The Paradox:** Despite affordability and accessibility, few users maximize AI's potential.

   - Knowing when to trust vs. verify

4. **Strategic Integration**
   - Deciding where AI adds value
   - Balancing speed with depth
   - Managing human-AI workflows

### Custom Workflows: The Power User Advantage

**What Top Performers Do:**

**Custom GPTs:**
> "I have a custom GPT built for this… it automatically analyzes exactly how I want it." — Daniel

**Cross-Platform Integration:**
> "Use ChatGPT to give us good prompts that I then use in Lovable." — Viktor

**Data Quality Focus:**
> "If you don't put in good data, you'll get a bad outcome." — Sofia

**The Pattern:**
Successful entrepreneurs don't just use AI—they **architect custom AI-driven workflows** tailored to their specific needs.

### Practical Strategies for Mastery

**Phase 1: Experimentation (Weeks 1-4)**
- Try multiple tools
- Learn basic prompting
- Identify use cases
- Accept the learning curve

**Phase 2: Specialization (Months 2-3)**
- Focus on 3-5 core tools
- Develop advanced prompting skills
- Create prompt libraries
- Build repeatable processes

**Phase 3: Customization (Months 4+)**
- Build custom GPTs
- Integrate cross-platform workflows
- Train team members
- Continuously optimize

### The Investment

**Time Required:**
- 10-20 hours to become competent
- 50-100 hours to become proficient
- Ongoing: 2-5 hours/week to stay current

**The Return:**
Entrepreneurs report **50% productivity increases** and **75% cost reductions** once they master AI integration.

**The Bottom Line:** AI literacy is becoming as essential as digital literacy was in the 2000s—except it's evolving faster.

## The Transformation of Entrepreneurship

AI isn't just changing individual workflows—it's reshaping the entire entrepreneurial landscape.

### Micro Impact: Individual Entrepreneur Level

**Empowerment & Productivity Gains:**
> "Our income has gone up probably 50% and I would lay that at the feet of AI." — Erik

> "I am not dependent—I am **empowered**." — Erik

> "Helps me stay so much more efficient… quick answers, quick results in a very fast stimulating way." — Sofia

**Positive Changes:**
- Rapid skill acquisition
- Lower barriers to technical execution
- Ability to compete with larger teams
- Faster validation and iteration

**But Also... Dependency & Stress:**
> "All my job now is towards AI. You cannot go back to before." — Sofia

> "It doesn't make my job easier… you go so fast that you are still super busy." — Sofia

> "I'm always behind everything. It's super frustrating. It's going so fast, it's crazy." — Sofia

**The Paradox:**
AI simultaneously empowers and creates dependency. Productivity gains don't reduce stress—they enable more work.

### Competitive Pressure Intensifies

**The New Reality:**
> "More competition because it's become much easier to generate ideas." — Viktor

> "A little bit more stressed because the competition is doing nearly the same." — Martin

> "AI doesn't help me be competitive because all my competitors are doing the same." — Sofia

**Key Insight:**
AI is becoming **table stakes**, not a differentiator. The competitive advantage comes from **how effectively** you use AI, not just that you use it.

**Expectations Rising:**
> "Expectations are higher across the board." — Magnus

Customers and investors now expect faster development, more features, and higher quality—because AI makes it possible.

### Macro Impact: Industry Transformation

**Evolution of Ventures:**

**AI-First Strategies:**
> "Implementing AI as much as possible in our whole workflow." — Frank

**Team Structure Changes:**
> "Make the teams much smaller." — Johan

> "Every company is creating their own AI in the near future." — Sofia

**Process Restructuring:**
- Traditional workflows being redesigned around AI capabilities
- New roles emerging (prompt engineers, AI integration specialists)
- Democratization of previously expert-only skills

**Barriers to Entry:**

**Lower in Some Ways:**
- Technical execution easier (coding, design)
- Reduced capital requirements
- Faster time-to-market

**Higher in Others:**
- AI literacy required
- Tool complexity
- Faster competitive cycles
- Quality expectations increased

### The Human Element: What Remains Irreplaceable

**Despite AI's capabilities, humans remain essential for:**

1. **Strategic Vision** - AI can't decide what business to build
2. **Risk-Taking** - AI has no "skin in the game"
3. **Stakeholder Relationships** - Trust requires human connection
4. **Ethical Judgment** - Moral decisions need human values
5. **Cultural Context** - Understanding nuance beyond data
6. **Creative Boldness** - True innovation requires courage
7. **Emotional Intelligence** - Empathy can't be algorithmic

### The Future Landscape

**Near Term (1-2 years):**
- AI becomes mandatory, not optional
- Tool consolidation likely
- Prompt engineering becomes standard skill
- Human-AI collaboration models mature

**Medium Term (3-5 years):**
- Custom AI agents become common
- Industry-specific AI tools proliferate
- New business models emerge around AI
- Regulatory frameworks develop

**The Question Remains:**
Can AI be a co-founder? The research suggests **not yet**—and perhaps not ever. But it can be an invaluable team member, consultant, and accelerator.

**The Answer:**
> "It's not a co-founder, but I see it more as a consultant." — Johan

AI lacks the commitment, risk-tolerance, and strategic vision of a true co-founder. But as a tool and collaborator, it's transforming what's possible in entrepreneurship.

- Competitive pressure intensifying
- Team structures evolving
- Productivity gains don't reduce workload

**5. The "Co-Founder" Question**
AI is better described as "first employee," "junior team member," or "consultant"—not co-founder. It lacks skin in the game, strategic vision, and risk tolerance.

### The Human-AI Collaboration Model

**Key Innovation from This Research:**

**Participatory Stages** (Human-in-the-Loop):
- **Empathize**: Direct user engagement essential
- **Ideate**: Active curation of AI outputs required
- **Test**: Human-led validation irreplaceable

**Supervisory Stages** (Human-on-the-Loop):
- **Define**: Interpret AI insights, frame problems
- **Prototype**: Guide functionality, ensure quality

This dynamic collaboration model acknowledges that different stages require different human involvement levels.

### Practical Implications for Entrepreneurs

1. ✅ Invest in AI literacy early
2. ✅ Develop custom workflows for your context
3. ✅ Maintain human oversight at critical junctures
4. ✅ Focus on AI *effectiveness*, not just usage
5. ✅ Balance speed with depth and quality
6. ✅ Use AI to empower, not create dependency

**Avoid This:**
1. ❌ Blindly trusting AI outputs
2. ❌ Accepting generic AI-generated ideas as final
3. ❌ Letting speed compromise strategic thinking
4. ❌ Over-relying on tools without understanding
5. ❌ Chasing every new AI tool
6. ❌ Neglecting traditional entrepreneurial skills

### Theoretical Contributions

This research advances entrepreneurial innovation literature by:

1. **Mapping Concrete Practice Shifts** - Not just theoretical possibilities but real changes
2. **Identifying Stage-Specific Impacts** - Different DT stages affected differently
3. **Documenting Adaptive Strategies** - How entrepreneurs respond to AI complexity
4. **Proposing Collaboration Model** - Framework for human-AI interaction

### Study Limitations

**Acknowledged Constraints:**
- 9 participants (qualitative depth over statistical generalization)
- Snapshot in time (AI evolving rapidly)
- Digital/software bias (physical products less impacted)
- Early adopter sample (may not represent all entrepreneurs)

### Future Research Directions

**Questions to Explore:**
1. How do AI collaboration patterns evolve over time?
2. What are long-term impacts on entrepreneurial identity?
3. How does AI affect team dynamics and culture?
4. What regulatory frameworks are needed?
5. How do different industries adapt differently?

### Final Thoughts

**The Paradox Summarized:**

AI is simultaneously:
- **Empowering** and **dependency-creating**
- **Accelerating** and **demanding-deeper-thought**
- **Democratizing** and **intensifying-competition**
- **Productivity-boosting** and **stress-inducing**

**The Path Forward:**

Success in the AI era requires:
- **Continuous learning** - Tools evolve constantly
- **Strategic integration** - Not just using AI, but using it well
- **Human-centered approach** - AI augments, doesn't replace
- **Critical thinking** - Question outputs, maintain judgment
- **Balanced adoption** - Speed with depth, scale with quality

**The Answer to "Can AI Be a Co-Founder?"**

Not in the traditional sense. AI lacks:
- Commitment and risk-bearing
- Strategic vision and business acumen
- Emotional stake in outcomes
- Ethical judgment and values
- Creative boldness and innovation

But as a powerful collaborator, accelerator, and force multiplier? Absolutely.

**The entrepreneurs who thrive will be those who master the art of human-AI collaboration—leveraging AI's speed and scale while preserving the human elements that make entrepreneurship transformative.**

AI is becoming table stakes, not a differentiator. The advantage comes from how effectively you use AI, not just that you use it.',

    question: 'What is the "productivity paradox" of AI in entrepreneurship?',
    answer: 'Despite dramatic speed improvements (50% income increases, 75% cost reductions), entrepreneurs report being "super busy" and "always behind everything." Speed enables more iterations rather than reducing workload. As one founder noted: "It doesn\'t make my job easier... you go so fast that you are still super busy."',

    question: 'How do successful entrepreneurs customize AI for their needs?',
    answer: 'Top performers build custom GPTs tailored to specific tasks, create cross-platform workflows (e.g., using ChatGPT to generate prompts for other tools), and develop prompt chains for sequential processing. They architect AI-driven workflows specific to their contexts rather than just using off-the-shelf solutions.',

    difficulty: 'hard',
    question: 'What elements of entrepreneurship remain irreplaceable by AI?',
    answer: 'Humans remain essential for: strategic vision (deciding what business to build), risk-taking (having "skin in the game"), stakeholder relationships (trust requires human connection), ethical judgment, cultural context understanding, creative boldness, and emotional intelligence. AI cannot replicate these fundamental entrepreneurial qualities.',
