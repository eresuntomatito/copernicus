Abstract
Fueled by rapid advancements and widespread adoption, Artificial Intelligence (AI)
is transforming how Design Thinking (DT) is applied in entrepreneurship. While DT
is a well-established human-centered innovation framework, the integration of AI in
its practical application, along with the emerging challenges and adaptive strategies,
remains underexplored. To address this gap, a qualitative research design was employed,
comprising nine semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurial design thinkers actively
integrating AI into their workflows. Data was analyzed using the Gioia methodology.
Findings indicate that AI significantly accelerates and scales all five DT stages: automating
user research in Empathize, streamlining problem framing in Define, augmenting human
creativity in Ideate, speeding up prototyping through code and design tools in Prototype,
and enabling data-driven insights in Test.
However, without human oversight, these
benefits are accompanied by limitations, including limited AI-generated novelty, reduced
depth, reliability concerns and over-reliance. Users respond by developing AI literacy
and creating custom workflows to navigate complexity. A key insight, visualized in a
conceptual model, is the evolving dynamic of human-AI collaboration, with human roles
shifting between participatory and supervisory depending on the DT stage. This research
advances understanding of AI-driven innovation by mapping concrete shifts in practice and
mindset within entrepreneurial design thinking. The results offer theoretical contributions
to entrepreneurial innovation literature and provide practical guidance for entrepreneurs
aiming to integrate AI effectively into their creative processes.
Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Generative AI, Design Thinking, Entrepreneurship,
Innovation Process, Human-AI Collaboration, Entrepreneurial Strategies

1 Introduction
1.1 Overview
As artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes industries and redefines boundaries, for entrepreneurs, a
provocative question arises: “Can AI serve as a co-founder in modern entrepreneurship?” This
paper investigates this proposition, specifically exploring how AI interacts with and transforms
the activities in the Design Thinking (DT) process within entrepreneurial context.
The
Fourth Industrial Revolution, enabling powerful computing and expanding AI’s commercial
applications, saw a pivotal acceleration with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November
2022 (OpenAI, 2022). The AI chatbot marks the beginning of widespread, consumer-ready
access to AI tools for everyday tasks. So-called generative AI has democratized artificial
intelligence, transforming it from a domain of complex algorithms accessible only to experts
into an everyday tool (Gomstyn and Jonker, 2024).
With its free, web-based availability,
ChatGPT marked the beginning of mainstream AI’s integration into everyday life, reaching
400 million active weekly users by February 2025 (Reuters, 2025).
With generative AI becoming increasingly integrated into society, the topic is gaining more
prominence in news articles (Ryazanov et al., 2024), on social media platforms, as well as
in scientific research (Ray, 2023).
Some publications frame AI as a sparring partner for
launching and growing businesses, like an article by Brown (2024) on the MIT Sloan School
of Management website that takes the same approach, discussing the use of AI in a co-founder
role and how generative AI is changing entrepreneurship. The possibility of using AI tools to
handle various side tasks so that the entrepreneur can focus on his core competencies is the main
idea of the article (Brown, 2024). AI can act as a guiding coach to the entrepreneur, helping
to build and quickly validate businesses (Vecchiarini and Somià, 2023). This shift is driving
a re-evaluation of the entrepreneurial process that promotes the rapid development of new
ventures by enhancing agility and innovation while simultaneously making these capabilities
more accessible. This emerging approach has been recognized in the scientific literature as the
AI-enabled entrepreneurial process (Giuggioli and Pellegrini, 2023).
If new ventures effectively integrate AI into their day-to-day activities and leverage it as a core
component of their business’ growth, they will be able to be on the forefront of innovation

(Samal et al., 2024). At the same time, DT has become a widely adopted approach in business
creation, offering a much-needed framework to tackle uncertainty and problem-solving in
entrepreneurship (Glen et al., 2014).
It has proven to be especially useful for navigating
ambiguity and developing innovative solutions in dynamic markets (Micheli et al., 2019). With
its roots in human-centered innovation, DT emphasizes a practical approach to problem-solving
through iterative experimentation and rapid learning (Brown, 2008), making it an ideal tool for
entrepreneurs adapting to evolving customer needs. By fostering an empathetic understanding
of users, the framework helps startups align their solutions with real-world demands, enabling
faster, more reliable validation and more effective business strategies (Glen et al., 2014). With
the emergence of AI as a tool for enhancing decision-making and problem-solving capabilities,
important questions can be raised about its increasing impact on DT.
This evolving landscape raises a critical question: To what extent and in what ways can AI
augment or affects the roles and activities traditionally performed by human (co-founders),
especially with regard to the creative and strategic rigor required by processes such as Design
Thinking? This study aims to shed light on these dynamics.
1.2 Purpose of Study
Despite the widespread recognition of AI’s transformative potential and its growing use in
entrepreneurship, the fundamental interaction between AI and innovation methods, such as DT,
remains underexplored. This research does not focus solely on AI as an isolated technology
or on DT in its traditional form. Rather, its relevance stems from the need to understand the
emerging dynamics, tensions, and conceptual shifts that can arise at the intersection of these
two different methods in entrepreneurship: one probabilistic and data-driven, and the other
human-centered and abductive. This study is motivated by the unknowns emerging at the
intersection of human and machine-led innovation. As AI continues to develop rapidly, its
application to DT remains a new and emerging area, making it a compelling topic for further
study. While DT excels in out-of-the-box thinking, caused by deep human empathy and creative
divergence (Rösch et al., 2023), current generative AI excels at identifying patterns in large
datasets and giving probable outputs (Fui-Hoon Nah et al., 2023). However, its dependence on
existing knowledge may limit the potential for radical innovation that DT in entrepreneurship
strives to foster, making its ability to co-create genuinely novel value uncertain.

Furthermore, the established stages of DT provide an iterative structure for innovation. AI’s
ability to rapidly process, synthesize, and generate information introduces the possibility of
fundamentally altering this process.
It is therefore interesting to research whether certain
distinct stages begin to merge or become interconnected due to the impact of AI, which would
reshape the architecture of the entrepreneurial DT process. Understanding the effect of AI’s
outputs on DT is especially compelling given that the true origin of the content is inherently
unknown in AI’s black-box design. This raises questions about how humans in the process
deal with AI-generated insights, their own intuition and experience, and what strategies could
emerge to amplify the process rather than constrain it.
Cautela et al. (2019) offer the only study directly examining the impact of AI on the DT process.
The study raises concerns about the long-term impact on creative and strategic processes. It
suggests that, while AI may accelerate certain stages, it shifts creativity from problem framing to
solution generation, contradicting the core principles of DT (Cautela et al., 2019). The authors
also warn that AI could replace human-centered validation throughout the process (Cautela
et al., 2019). However, the study has limitations, including its reliance on secondary data and
focus on well-funded startups, and it calls for further qualitative research to gain deeper insights
into AI’s real-world influence (Cautela et al., 2019).
Given the alignment between the entrepreneurial process and DT, the framework serves as a
useful lens through which to examine the influence of AI on entrepreneurship. As many new
ventures use this framework to improve problem solving, iteration, and innovation (Brown,
2008), investigating how AI interacts with each stage can provide insight into its real-world
benefits and limitations. However, rapid AI advancements pose a risk of quickly outdating
research in terms of the examined technology, underscoring the need for ongoing, up-to-date
research that captures the evolving landscape and its implications. Therefore, this study is
motivated by the urgent need to examine the complex and evolving relationship between AI
and human-centric innovation methodologies in the entrepreneurial landscape.
1.3 Research Aim
This research aims to investigate and understand the influence of artificial intelligence on
the DT process applied in an entrepreneurial setting, providing additional insights into its
integration and impact. In doing so, the study aims to explore how the activities in the different
3

### Page 9

stages of the DT process are affected by the use of artificial intelligence, assessing particularly
the speed and scale across all stages. This study explores AI’s role in enhancing creativity
and efficiency versus its potential to introduce new barriers, constraints, and dependencies.
Additional objectives are identifying and analyzing potential emerging challenges that arise
from using AI in this context, as well as adaptive strategies that individuals involved in the
process employ to navigate these issues and optimize outcomes leveraging AI.
1.4 Research Question
In order to fulfill the purpose of study and the research aim, the following research question
will be investigated in this paper:
“How does artificial intelligence affect the activities involved in the design thinking process in
entrepreneurship, and what challenges and strategies emerge in its practical application?”
This question explores how AI interacts with the activities that make up the different stages
of the DT process as applied to entrepreneurship. These activities are explored additionally
on speed and scale dimensions to analyze the impact of AI on each stage. Speed refers to the
time and rate at which the users can progress through the activities of each stage of the DT
process. Scale refers to the ability to expand solutions and ideas beyond small projects to reach
larger audiences without proportionally increasing resources, while also managing the increased
operational complexity that comes with it. It also refers to the range of opportunities and
problems that can be explored and addressed, as well as the diversity of solutions. Additionally,
the research question focuses on the challenges and strategies that emerge in the practical
application of AI in entrepreneurship. Using the DT process to study entrepreneurship provides
a clear, structured way to analyze the early stages of the entrepreneurial process.

2 Theoretical Framework
The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the underlying concepts used, discussed,
and applied in this study.
The topics covered are DT and AI, and how they are used in
combination in entrepreneurship.
2.1 Entrepreneurship and Design Thinking
2.1.1 Design Thinking as part of the Entrepreneurial Process
As described by Kessler and Frank (2009), starting a new business is a process. A formal
definition of this process – one that every entrepreneur more or less goes through – states that it
encompasses “all the functions, activities, and actions associated with perceiving opportunities
and creating organizations to pursue them” (Bygrave, 2009). In other words, it is the process of
turning an idea into a viable business, involving opportunity recognition and the subsequent
steps required to exploit that opportunity. This process view of entrepreneurship is widely
adopted in scholarly work. As entrepreneurs move through this process, DT has emerged as
a valuable methodology for navigating its uncertainty (Carella et al., 2023; Kayyali, 2024).
DT is a human-centered approach to problem-solving that prioritizes user needs, collaborative
ideation, and experimental prototyping to develop innovative solutions (Brown, 2008). The
DT process provides a structured yet flexible framework for problem-solving, emphasizing
iteration, experimentation, and user-centered innovation (Brown, 2008).
While different
variations exist, one of the most widely recognized models is the five-stage framework
developed by the Stanford d.school: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test (Meinel
et al., 2011; Stanford d.school, nd). This process is not strictly linear, allowing teams to revisit
earlier stages as new insights emerge (Verganti et al., 2020). Although this five-stage model is
widely adopted, alternative frameworks also exist. IDEO’s model simplifies the process into
three phases: Inspiration, Ideation, and Implementation (Micheli et al., 2019), while the Double
Diamond model proposed by the UK Design Council emphasizes a divergent-convergent
approach to problem-solving (Cautela et al., 2019). This study however will focus on the DT
process as described by the Stanford d.school, because it is one of the most influential applied
models of DT and for many the first one that comes to mind (Micheli et al., 2019).

### Page 11

When laid next to the entrepreneurial process, several fundamental similarities can be observed.
Both are process-driven frameworks for innovation, iterative in nature and focused on value
creation and problem-solving (Bhave, 1994; Mcmullen and Dimov, 2013; Carella et al., 2023).
However, despite this common ground, there is a clear difference in emphasis and scope between
the entrepreneurial process and the DT process. This difference, which in the case of this study
is particularly relevant, is their ultimate focus and outcome. The entrepreneurial process is
directed towards building a new venture: it encompasses not just conceiving a solution, but
also organizing a business around it, acquiring resources, and managing a company to deliver
the solution to the market. Its end point is a functioning and (ideally) growing business. DT, on
the other hand, is generally focused on designing a specific innovation or solution to a defined
problem. The outcome of a DT project is typically a tested prototype or a refined solution
concept, not a full-fledged business operation. Indeed, Mueller and Thoring (2012) observed
that traditional DT frameworks do not explicitly include steps for developing a business model
or obtaining resources for implementation. Nevertheless, DT methods can support various
phases early-stage ventures go through, since DT excels at the front end of innovation (problem
finding and problem solving), whereas the entrepreneurial process covers the entire journey
through venture execution and growth. This difference excludes key entrepreneurial concerns
like business planning, revenue models, funding, and leadership from the five-stage DT model.
However, the boundary between the entrepreneurial and DT processes is often unclear, as it
heavily depends on the specific context and can overlap.
2.1.2 Design Thinking for Entrepreneurship
DT has been identified as a promising approach for new ventures, offering a human-centred,
structured framework to navigate the uncertainty of new business creation (Carella et al.,
2023; Kayyali, 2024). Startups often face challenges in their early stages, and DT’s emphasis
on empathy, creativity, and iteration directly targets these challenges (Dunne, 2018).
By
incorporating DT from the outset, entrepreneurs can generate innovative solutions and mitigate
risk through continuous learning (Carella et al., 2023; Kayyali, 2024).
In practice, many startups inherently follow a DT-like approach, even if this happens
subconsciously or they only go through a few of its stages.
The early stages of the
entrepreneurial process naturally involve similar activities, making it align closely with
6

### Page 12

the DT process. The first stage of the latter, “Empathize”, is used by founders to discover
insights that would remain hidden in a purely technology-driven or product-centric approach
(Carella et al., 2023). Dunne (2018) notes that successful innovators prioritize user-centric
problem framing, ensuring that early ideas are relevant and meaningful to the target market.
In an entrepreneurial context, the Empathize stage often involves techniques like customer
observation, empathy mapping, interviews and early field research to validate that a genuine
problem exists (Razzouk and Shute, 2012; Johansson-Sköldberg et al., 2013; Carella et al.,
2023). Focusing on users from the outset increases the chances of targeting a real opportunity
rather than a hypothetical one. By emphatically understanding the job-to-be-done from the
user’s viewpoint, entrepreneurs build a strong empathic basis for innovation (Kayyali, 2024).
Insights gathered through empathizing are next synthesized in the “Define” stage, where
entrepreneurs clearly articulate the core problem or opportunity their startup will tackle. Davis
(2010) emphasizes that founders must define what is most important without prematurely
narrowing their focus.
In practice, this might mean an entrepreneur reframes an initially
assumed problem after uncovering deeper user motivations.
DT encourages reframing as
needed; rather than accepting the first problem definition, entrepreneurs challenge assumptions
and look at the issue from multiple angles. Beckman and Barry (2007) caution that skipping
this thoughtful problem-definition phase can lead teams to iterate on surface-level issues while
missing underlying needs.
Thus, defining helps entrepreneurs ensure they are solving the
“right” problem - one that is significant to users and viable for the business. The outcome
is a well-framed challenge that guides ideation and keeps the venture’s efforts aligned with real
user needs (Dorst, 2011; Carella et al., 2023).
With a clear problem definition in hand, entrepreneurs enter the “Ideate” stage. Here, DT’s
emphasis on divergent thinking comes into action. Founders are encouraged to be creative
and think out-of-the-box, exploring many possible business ideas or product features before
later honing in on the most promising ones. Kayyali (2024) underscores that cultivating a
creative mindset is a catalyst for entrepreneurial innovation . The ideation process often involves
known techniques in entrepreneurship such as brainstorming, mind mapping, and sketching
concepts. Carella et al. (2023) found that entrepreneurs trained in DT particularly valued the
diverging and converging dynamics of this stage - first generating diverse options (diverging),
then selecting and refining the best concepts (converging). Ideating therefore expands the range
7

### Page 13

of opportunities and fosters innovative thinking, laying multiple paths the new venture could
pursue.
Next, the most promising idea is made tangible in the “Prototype” stage. For entrepreneurs,
prototyping means creating low-fidelity versions of the product or service with the goal of
exploring how the idea might work in practice. Examples of prototypes are rough sketches,
storyboards, role-playing scenarios and simplified physical models. Brown (2009) advocates
prototyping from day one, urging teams to fail early to succeed sooner. In entrepreneurship,
this means testing parts of the business idea well before developing a full product. Carella
et al. (2023) found that entrepreneurs who applied DT went through prototype iteration and
experimentation to generate potential business ideas.
By prototyping in a hands-on way,
founders can quickly discover what works and what doesn’t, refining their ideas before
committing major resources.
Finally, the “Test” stage brings the idea and prototypes back to the end-user for feedback. For
an early-stage venture, this stage is critical to validate assumptions and refine the business
model. It might involve usability testing sessions, customer interviews about the prototype
experience, or small-scale pilot launches. The feedback is then looped back into redefining the
problem or iterating on the solution, linking back to the earlier stages. This iterative testing
significantly lowers the inherent risk that comes with innovation: rather than investing blindly,
the venture evolves through validated learning (Beckman and Barry, 2007). Testing ensures
(new) ventures are aligned with user expectations and market realities. It helps entrepreneurs
pivot when needed or build confidence from positive feedback, steering the startup toward a
reliable product-market fit.
This study adopts the DT process as an analytical tool to structure and interpret the results.
As outlined above, the stages of the DT process closely align with activities performed in
early-stage entrepreneurship – where uncertainty is highest and user understanding, rapid
iteration, and creative problem-solving are most critical. Apart from the fact that it is a phase
where entrepreneurs often apply DT, whether that be consciously or not, it is also where the
use of a technology such as AI becomes the most compelling. Therefore, by focusing on
this intersection, this study can more meaningfully analyze how AI influences entrepreneurial
capabilities and venture performance.

2.2 Entrepreneurship and Artificial Intelligence
AI is increasingly recognized as a transformative factor shaping entrepreneurship. Its rapid
advancement in various entrepreneurial domains requires a comprehensive understanding of its
current use cases, applications, and limitations.
2.2.1 History and Definition of Artificial Intelligence
Research on AI began in the 1930s and 1940s, with key milestones including the first neural
network by McCulloch, Pitts, and Hebbs (Crevier, 1993) and Alan Turing’s (1950) foundational
work on machine intelligence. The formal founding of AI as an academic field occurred at
the 1956 Dartmouth Conference (Crevier, 1993), although progress was slowed by two major
AI winters in the 1970s and 1980s (Toosi et al., 2021). AI regained public attention when
IBM’s Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 (Campbell et al.,
2002), and McCarthy (2007) later defined AI as the science of creating intelligent machines
without necessarily mimicking biological methods. Advances in computing power and the
emergence of Industry 4.0 in the 2010s have since accelerated AI’s growth, particularly in
industrial applications (Toosi et al., 2021).
Since the founding of OpenAI in 2015 (Brockman and Sutskever, 2015), a company dedicated
to developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of humanity, several
groundbreaking models have been developed (Altman, 2023). The most impactful was the
release of ChatGPT, a conversational model based on their GPT-3.5 architecture, which is
offered as an open-ended chatbot that can be used for multiple tasks such as summarizing,
analyzing data, translating, or generating content at a better and more robust level than ever
before (Abdullah et al., 2022). The scientific community is also showing great interest in such
a transformative tool, as evidenced by more than 3000 articles on ChatGPT published in Google
Scholar within the first five months of its release (Ray, 2023).
The software company IBM defines AI today as “technology that enables computers and
machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making,
creativity and autonomy” (Stryker and Kavlakoglu, 2024). The layers and levels of AI (Fig. 1)
that exist and are most commonly known are explained by IBM as follows: The first layer
term is machine learning which is a concept nested within AI and describes an algorithm that
9

### Page 15

is able to be trained on data to make predictions or decisions. This is also commonly known
as predictive AI. The most popular type of machine learning are neural networks, which are
networks modeled after the human brain and aim to work in a similar function. A subset
of machine learning is deep learning, which utilizes neural networks with multiple layers,
mimicking the complexity of the human brain.
The latest and most commonly popular subset of deep learning is Generative AI, which is
described as “deep learning models that can create complex original content - such as long-form
text, high-quality images, realistic video or audio and more - in response to a user’s prompt or
request” (Stryker and Kavlakoglu, 2024). Especially transformer models, trained on sequenced
data to generate more sequences of data, are publicly known as they are used in tools like
ChatGPT or Gemini.
Figure 1: Layers of Artificial Intelligence (Stryker and Kavlakoglu, 2024)
Generative AI models like ChatGPT come from Natural Language Processing (NLP), a branch
of AI that enables machines to understand and produce human language (Haleem et al.,
2022). Large Language Models (LLMs) though have revolutionized NLPs as they, based on
AI-driven neural networks, are trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate,
and process human language, enabling applications like chatbots, language translation, and text
summarization more effectively and more accurate than before (Ray, 2023). ChatGPT and
similar chatbots are typically referred to as LLMs.

2.2.2 AI as an Enabler in Entrepreneurship
Even before the introduction of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, AI was seen as an
enabler for entrepreneurs or businesses in general for example in decision-making context
(Rajagopal et al., 2022) or opportunity recognition (Shepherd and Majchrzak, 2022). These
systems were already viewed as collaborative tools that enhanced performance and even
took on teammate-like roles (Seeber et al., 2020). Building on this foundation, AI supports
the nurturing of emerging entrepreneurial opportunities by facilitating the redistribution of
skills and enhancing human-AI collaboration (Shepherd and Majchrzak, 2022). The role of
AI as an enabler for entrepreneurship is particularly evident in innovation and supportive
decision-making (Davidsson and Sufyan, 2023). However, despite these benefits, AI lacks
human intuition and should thus be regarded as a tool that enhances human creativity and
decision-making rather than a substitute for human inventiveness (Davidsson and Sufyan,
2023). While AI is unlikely to fully replace human entrepreneurs, strategically collaborating
with it is crucial for staying competitive (Giuggioli and Pellegrini, 2023).
2.2.3 AI Applications in Entrepreneurship
Classical AI applications support entrepreneurs in opportunity identification, decision making,
performance optimization, and education and research, leading Giuggioli and Pellegrini (2023)
to define this integration as the AI-enabled entrepreneurial process, showcasing how AI is
a transformative force in entrepreneurship. The first step, AI-enabled opportunity creation
includes the discovery of new digital transformations, innovative products or services to reshape
traditional businesses (Giuggioli and Pellegrini, 2023). For the second step of the framework,
decision making, Giuggioli and Pellegrini (2023) focus on predictive analytics powered by
machine learning that can help entrepreneurs navigate uncertainty and validate business models.
In the third step, performance optimization focuses on automating repetitive tasks and analyzing
customer behavior or sales strategies using AI tools (Giuggioli and Pellegrini, 2023). For the
last part of education and research, the AI-enabled entrepreneurial process frameworks focus on
implementing AI as a learning tool, using new technologies and teaching methods (Giuggioli
and Pellegrini, 2023).
AI presents unique opportunities for efficiency and innovation along the entrepreneurial
process, especially idea generation, scaling and organizational design improvements (Chalmers
11

### Page 17

et al., 2021). When used as an augmentation tool, AI is valuable to entrepreneurs in terms of
opportunity recognition, decision making, efficiency, and scaling (Shepherd and Majchrzak,
2022).
Moreover, the adoption and integration of AI has proven to enhance operational
efficiency through AI-driven insights (Jeremiah, 2025).
2.2.4 Generative AI’s Role and Impact
Fueled by abundant data, classical AI tools have long supported entrepreneurship, but
Obschonka and Audretsch (2020) anticipated a disruptive shift in AI that will further transform
the field.
This predicted development is now evident in the rise of generative AI, which
democratizes AI use, making it accessible not just to experts, but to everyone. The question
arises whether generative AI, in contrast to traditional AI, has expanded its application
in entrepreneurship beyond its primary reliance on Big Data to a broader range of fields
(Obschonka and Audretsch, 2020).
The transformative impact of generative AI on various stages of the entrepreneurial process
is already evident.
Boussioux et al. (2024) and Girotra et al. (2023) found that while
human-generated business ideas still lead in creativity and novelty, AI-assisted concepts tend
to be more viable and of higher quality. The authors underscore the importance of utilizing
AI tools in a human-centered, collaborative manner, emphasizing its role in enhancing quality
outcomes in creative endeavors (Boussioux et al., 2024).
Vecchiarini and Somia (Vecchiarini and Somià, 2023) also highlighted the potential of
generative AI tools like ChatGPT in entrepreneurship.
In their study, students using AI
to improve their business model canvases reported positive outcomes in rapid validation,
customer development, and pitch preparation (Vecchiarini and Somià, 2023). AI integration
makes new ventures more competitive, facilitates for a smoother market penetration and
increases customer engagement by offering more personalized experiences than ever before
(Samal et al., 2024). While the tool facilitated creativity, Vecchiarini and Somià (2023) noted
that hallucinations or erroneous outputs could impact outcomes, underscoring the necessity for
human oversight when utilizing such tools.
12

### Page 18

2.2.5 Ethical Concerns and Limitations of AI in Entrepreneurship
Besides faulty outputs, there are additional ethical concerns and limitations associated with
AI. Giuggioli and Pellegrini (2023) highlight specific ethical issues such as inequality, job
displacement, and the need to democratize access to AI – drawbacks that warrant further
exploration. More broadly, Shepherd and Majchrzak (2022) emphasize that AI has a darker
side, characterized by biased algorithms and a lack of transparency in decision-making
processes, complicating accountability. They also stress that the potential exploitation of AI
for unethical practices must remain a consideration in AI research (Shepherd and Majchrzak,
2022). Moreover, when compared to human outputs, the content and ideas generated solely by
generative AI can sometimes be generic, lacking the creativity and variety typically produced
by humans (Doshi and Hauser, 2023).
2.2.6 Human versus Artificial Intelligence Capabilities
For entrepreneurs, Giuggioli and Pellegrini (2023) do not anticipate that AI will fully replace
them. Instead, they emphasize the importance of viewing AI as a tool that complements and
enhances human capabilities by leveraging its strengths in accuracy, speed and scale (Giuggioli
and Pellegrini, 2023). Several studies support the idea that humans still lead in areas like
creativity but benefit from collaborating with AI as mentioned by Boussioux et al. (2024) and
Girotra et al. (2023). In the end it is the entrepreneurs’ instinctive and risk-taking nature, which
has traditionally been a driver of change, but it has been fundamentally transformed due to the
emergence and rapid advancement of AI (Jeremiah, 2025). This challenges entrepreneurs to
develop AI literacy and use AI as a collaborative tool, rather than seeing it as a replacement. This
ensures that human creativity, strategic vision, and ethics remain at the core of entrepreneurship
(Jeremiah, 2025).
Further research is needed to fully grasp AI’s transformative role in entrepreneurship, primarily
due to the tech’s novelty. Obschonka et al. (2024) highlights this gap in scholarship, calling
for research that emphasizes balancing exploring new possibilities with establishing a rigorous,
evidence-based scientific foundation in entrepreneurship. Bridging this gap between theory and
practice is crucial to understand the impact of AI, especially generative AI, on entrepreneurship.
The existing literature already shows that the integration of AI into entrepreneurship is reshaping
13

---

### Page 19

business environments and practices, and providing entrepreneurs with a diverse set of advanced
skills. However, while AI-driven tools offer advantages in efficiency and scalability, they
also pose challenges in terms of technical limitations, bias and ethical concerns.
As AI
rapidly evolves and its role in entrepreneurship is likely to expand, entrepreneurs benefit from
harnessing its potential while keeping human ingenuity at the core of their venture creation.
2.3 AI-Driven Design Thinking in Entrepreneurship
Although the concept of applying AI to the DT process in the context of entrepreneurship is not
new, it is under-researched. According to Cautela et al. (2019), concurrent advances in AI and
machine learning are reshaping how companies manage knowledge and carry out design and
innovation processes. Rather than viewing AI as merely another tool, recent studies suggest it
is bringing data and algorithms to the core of creative problem-solving, potentially replacing
more traditional workflows (Verganti et al., 2020; Yu, 2025). By synthesizing recent academic
findings, this highlight how AI is reshaping DT activities in entrepreneurship and discuss its
practical implications.
Traditionally, DT has been a human-centered, iterative and abductive process (Verganti et al.,
2020). With the introduction of AI, an evolving synergy between artificial intelligence and DT
has emerged, which is showcased by AI improving efficiency, scalability and decision-making
(Cautela et al., 2019). AI does not replace the core principles used in DT, but rather reinforces
them through data-driven insights and automated analysis that were not previously possible
(Verganti et al., 2020; Mortati et al., 2023). Additionally, recent work by Figoli et al. (2022)
characterizes AI as a reliable teammate in early design phases, capable of managing complexity
and augmenting the entrepreneur’s creativity. Yu (2025) confirms that AI enhances creativity by
providing inspirational stimuli, helping entrepreneurs reach more divergent ideas. Furthermore,
AI enables a shift from episodic iteration (e.g. a few rounds of user testing before launch) to
continuous iteration throughout a product’s life (Yu, 2025). Verganti et al. (2020) highlight
that modern AI-driven design processes are intrinsically iterative, delivering solutions through
ongoing learning loops. Every user interaction with an AI-enabled product becomes a source
of data and feedback for the system to learn from.
Verganti et al. (2020) do also emphasize that AI is currently not able to fully replace
the role of humans in the DT process.
Where AI might take over parts of operational
14

### Page 20

decision-making, humans are still essential in deciding what problems should be solved,
shifting the entrepreneur’s role from problem-solving to problem-finding and, most importantly,
sense-making (Verganti et al., 2020). This interpretation is supported by Yu (2025), who sees
AI as an augmentative tool rather than a replacement for human creativity in the design process.
It requires careful integration to ultimately enhance design innovation and efficiency, while
balancing human intuition and strategic oversight (Yu, 2025). To innovate effectively, teams
must interpret algorithmic outputs while maintaining a human-centered vision – using AI as a
creative collaborator that grounds solutions in empathy and practical insight (Yu, 2025). Figoli
et al. (2022) echo this statement by advocating the use of AI in a more intermittent, on-demand
way to preserve a human-driven process, with AI acting as an outside expert contributing
variety.
2.3.1 Speed and Scale along the different Stages
The integration of AI to DT represents a significant evolution in entrepreneurial methodology.
As Obschonka and Audretsch (2020) note, AI technologies serve as external enablers and
facilitators of entrepreneurship, creating new opportunities for innovation and problem solving.
Chalmers et al. (2021) elaborate on this connection by examining the impact of AI on the factors
that precede venture creation and the activities of firms closely associated with DT processes.
In this report, the focus is on the speed and scale of the various stages of the DT process, as
used in entrepreneurship.
In the Empathize stage of the DT process AI can enhance across both dimensions. AI can
accelerate the collection and analysis of user sentiment data, which typically requires extensive
manual effort. AI-powered sentiment analysis and natural language processing can hereby
quickly analyze online and social content to uncover user needs and pain points (Gaspar et al.,
2016). Entrepreneurs have the opportunity to significantly scale and connect their knowledge
faster through AI-enabled approaches (Chalmers et al., 2021). Shepherd and Majchrzak (2022)
highlight that AI can collect customer data at scale and in real time, and even use facial
recognition to uncover hidden emotions for deeper empathetic insight.
In the Define stage AI enhances in several ways. Townsend and Hunt (2019) show that AI
accelerates problem definition by quickly identifying patterns in complex data sets that would
take humans much longer to recognize. AI systems can rapidly scan vast data to help define
15

---

### Page 21

problems with great precision and clarity. Simultaneously the scale of the Define stage can also
be improved: AI enables entrepreneurs to analyze much larger problem spaces than would
be possible manually (Obschonka and Audretsch, 2020). Tomy and Pardede (2018) show
how combining uncertainty factors with relevant datasets allows decision makers to select
favorable opportunities and identify high-impact uncertainties prior to startup. Lupp (2023)
observes that AI’s predictive capabilities support more precise problem definition by reducing
uncertainty in entrepreneurial contexts. However, Townsend and Hunt (2019) note that certain
aspects of entrepreneurial uncertainty remain inherently unpredictable, suggesting limitations
to AI’s scope expansion at the definition stage. Nevertheless, AI enables entrepreneurs to scale
problem analysis by incorporating more variables and perspectives, leading to more robust,
evidence-based problem definitions.
AI can have a transformative impact on this creative process of the Ideate stage. Boussioux
et al. (2024) experiment of comparing human to ChatGPT-aided submissions at a business
idea competitions showed that collaborative AI solutions could be generated in hours rather
in months, demonstrating a dramatic acceleration of the ideation process. AI also enabled
entrepreneurs to rapidly generate a high volume of ideas that match or exceed human
creativity, when used collaboratively, allowing for broader exploration of potential solutions
than traditional brainstorming (Boussioux et al., 2024). Notably, when using AI to role-play
expert personas, the AI-generated ideas achieved novelty ratings statistically indistinguishable
from those of human submissions, suggesting that AI can help entrepreneurs expand their
conceptual horizons (Boussioux et al., 2024). Supporting this further, Short and Short (2023)
demonstrate AI’s ability to rapidly generate business ideas, elevator pitches, crowdfunding
narratives, and marketing tweets. Davidsson and Sufyan (2023) add that generative AI can
scale entrepreneurial ideation by supporting theory development and producing flexible content
that can adopt different styles and perspectives.
The Prototype stage involves creating tangible versions of ideas for testing. Townsend and
Hunt (2019) describe how AI-powered design tools accelerate prototyping by rapidly generating
design variations from specified parameters, allowing entrepreneurs to move from concept to
testable prototype much faster. AI enables entrepreneurs to create and evaluate many more
prototypes than would be feasible manually.
Cockburn et al. (2019) highlight how large
datasets and learning algorithms can be turned toward entrepreneurial opportunity exploitation,
16

---

### Page 22

allowing entrepreneurs to test multiple approaches simultaneously. This scaling of prototype
development increases the likelihood of finding optimal solutions.
Developing Minimum Viable Products (MVP), requires entrepreneurs nowadays not only to be
designers, but also prompt designers, moving from creation to curation (Obschonka et al., 2024).
Prompt designing involves techniques such as supplying a small number of examples (few-shot
learning) or designing prompts instructing the model to adopt a role (role-based prompting)
to guide LLMs in generating responses (Lee et al., 2024). Prototyping has also become more
efficient (Cautela et al., 2019) and available to everyone even with little experience in design
or coding (Obschonka et al., 2024) thanks to advances in AI tools.
AI’s role in impacting the Test stage can look differently. Chalmers et al. (2021) demonstrate
how AI accelerates the testing phase by predicting customer reactions to a feature or price
change using existing data. This allows entrepreneurs to quickly iterate through variations
without the time-consuming process of recruiting participants for each test cycle (Chalmers
et al., 2021). Dellermann et al. (2019) describe a hybrid intelligence decision support system
validating business models through an iterative approach combining stakeholder interaction
with formal analysis. This approach lets entrepreneurs test solutions with more stakeholders
and variables than traditional methods, combining human and machine strength (Dellermann
et al., 2019). Agrawal et al. (2024) describe how AI expands the scope of testing by exploring,
otherwise hidden, complex combinatorial problem spaces, using predictive analytics, helping
entrepreneurs uncover innovative insights beyond conventional thinking.
2.3.2 Negative Impacts of Artificial Intelligence on Design Thinking
Integrating AI into DT at the early stages of a new venture is however not without potential
pitfalls. One of the main concerns is the risk to creativity: while AI can enhance idea generation,
it may also stifle human creativity through cognitive overload and dependency, reducing
divergent thinking (Yu, 2025). Yu (2025) also states that entrepreneurs might develop a passive
mindset by settling for quick, below-par results, making it harder to balance AI integration with
maintaining active engagement in the creative stages of the DT process. Ethical implications are
equally critical as AI-driven processes can embed unintended biases or privacy infringements,
requiring careful oversight to ensure fairness, transparency and accountability (Sreenivasan and
Suresh, 2024).
17

---

### Page 23

Operationally, the inherent complexity of some AI tools can pose challenges for new ventures,
where entrepreneurs struggle to understand AI’s decisions, hampering effective collaboration
and trust (Figoli et al., 2022).
Furthermore, transparency issues can result in unhealthy
trust dynamics, where teams might either blindly follow (partially) flawed AI suggestions or
disregard useful AI input, both scenarios hindering performance (Figoli et al., 2022). These
factors underscore that, without careful management, AI usage can undermine the creative,
ethical, and collaborative foundations of DT in early-stage entrepreneurship.
2.4 Literature Synthesis
In conclusion, this theoretical framework established DT as a pivotal process for navigating
early-stage entrepreneurial processes through its human-centered, iterative approach, while
simultaneously positioning AI as a transformative force capable of accelerating and scaling
entrepreneurial activities. The literature reveals a fundamental tension between DT’s reliance
on human empathy and abductive reasoning and AI’s data-driven, probabilistic nature. While
existing research explores AI in DT or entrepreneurship separately, or begins to assess their
intersection, a critical gap remains: Understanding the nuanced impacts on the activities, as
well as the challenges, and adaptive strategies that emerge when individuals apply AI to the
stages of the DT process. This review synthesizes that understanding this intersection is about
a potential reconfiguration of the DT process itself, demanding an empirical investigation into
how this disruptive technology transforms a time-tested innovation framework..

3 Methodology
In the following chapter, the research method chosen to specifically address the mentioned
research question is explained in more detail.
3.1 Introduction
This study aims to gain a deeper understanding of how AI affects the activities within the
DT process as applied in entrepreneurship.
Additionally, it explores the challenges and
strategic adaptations users may encounter when applying AI tools in practice. First, a literature
review was conducted to gain an overview of the topics of interest. Each cited paper was
reviewed for its journal’s significant scientific background. Because the research question
is multifaceted, a qualitative approach was chosen to address it. Specifically, this research
is based on nine semi-structured interviews with individuals who hold key decision-making
roles in entrepreneurial initiatives where the DT process is actively applied as part of their
venture development. In the following, the research design, divided into research philosophy,
research type, research strategy, sampling strategy, data collection and analysis, as well as the
study’s limitations, ethical considerations and trustworthiness are discussed in order to provide
a reliable and replicable overview of the study’s methodology.
3.2 Research Design
3.2.1 Research Philosophy
This section elaborates on the ontological and epistemological assumptions that underpin this
study. From an ontological perspective, the research assumed a constructionist stance, meaning
that reality is socially constructed and subjective, shaped by the experiences and interactions of
individuals, as well as context (Bell et al., 2022). This stance suits the topic, acknowledging that
AI use is shaped by personal experiences and evolving interpretations, not a single objective
reality.
In terms of epistemology, this study adopted an interpretivist philosophy, which emphasizes the
subjective nature of reality and acknowledges that knowledge is gained through understanding
how people make meaning of their experiences (Ryan, 2018). This approach aligned well
19

---

### Page 25

with the study’s aims, given that entrepreneurs’ perceived benefits and weaknesses of AI
integration in the DT process are shaped by the individuality of their experiences and therefore
not measurable. This perspective allowed for capturing nuanced, subjective insights rather than
seeking universal truths.
3.2.2 Research Type
Aligned with the research philosophy, this study followed a qualitative, abductive and
exploratory research approach. A qualitative approach is suited to understanding complex,
context-dependent phenomena, particularly where subjective meaning and interpretation are
central (Azungah, 2018). Given the limited prior research on the topic, the study seeked to
build understanding from the ground up, which is characteristic of an inductive approach
(Azungah, 2018). Furthermore, the research was exploratory in nature and abductive, aiming
to uncover patterns, themes, and insights related to the rapidly evolving field of AI, particularly
in its application to DT practices (Swedberg, 2020) and mapping onto the DT stages. This
approach allowed the study to remain open to new findings and adapt if unexpected insights
were to emerge (Swedberg, 2020).
3.2.3 Research Strategy
Since this study aims to build an understanding of how entrepreneurs integrate AI into the
DT process by gathering qualitative data, the Gioia method was used to structure the findings
that later led to findings (Gioia et al., 2013). By collecting data from real-world applications,
findings were deeply rooted in practical experiences, and hypotheses and theories related
to the benefits, limitations, and adaptations involved in using AI within early-stage venture
development can be constructed. Data collection and analysis occurred iteratively, meaning
that emerging themes shaped subsequent interviews.
3.2.4 Sampling Strategy
To address the research question, this study applied a non-probability sampling strategy aligned
with a qualitative, abductive approach. The primary goal was to gather in-depth, nuanced
insights from individuals with relevant, first-hand experience using AI for DT activities in
entrepreneurship.
20

### Page 26

Nine participants were selected based on purposive criteria to ensure relevance to the research
topic. No new emerging themes appeared in the later stages of data collection, suggesting
that thematic saturation had been reached and earlier findings were consistently reinforced.
Inclusion criteria required participants to, at the time of participation:
• Be directly involved in decision-making within an early-stage venture (e.g., founder,
venture builder, product lead, innovation strategist);
• Be directly involved in any activities that align with one or more stages of the DT process
(e.g., user research, ideation, prototyping, testing);
• Have practical experience with AI tools (such as ChatGPT, image generators, or other
generative technologies);
• Be able to reflect on their use of AI after the widespread availability of such tools in late
2022.
Participants were not required to explicitly label their process as “Design Thinking,” but their
involvement had to demonstrate alignment with its principles through specific activities they
carried out in their venture work. As part of the participant selection process, an initial screening
involved assessing the individual’s role within the company and the stage at which they became
involved to provide an early indication of their engagement in one or more stages of the DT
process.
The recruitment process began with purposive sampling, reviewing existing contacts to
identify individuals who matched the above outlined criteria. Where participants were already
accessible through existing connections, convenience sampling was applied, and outreach was
conducted via LinkedIn or WhatsApp. To reach beyond the immediate network, additional
individuals were identified through professional and academic communities and contacted
via LinkedIn. In one instance, snowball sampling was used when a participant recommended
another person who met the study’s criteria. This combination of methods enabled access to a
variety of participants with different relevant perspectives.
The sample reflects diversity in terms of age, professional background, geographic location, and
industry focus. All participants are based in countries across Northern and Western Europe, and
most fall within the 20–30 age group, with others between 30–50. Founding experience ranges
from as early as 2017 to as recent as 2025, allowing for a range of perspectives from both pre21

### Page 27

and post-generative-AI entrepreneurship. This diversity helped capture a broader view of the
research topic. Importantly, all participants were selected based on their ability to reflect on
their own practices, rather than in an attempt to statistically represent a broader population. A
summary table of participant characteristics is provided at the beginning of chapter 4 “Findings.”
This table states all interviewees participant ID, pseudonym, gender, age group, occupation,
industry, location and founding year of their first venture.
3.2.5 Data Collection Method
This study collected data through nine semi-structured interviews, a method well-suited to
qualitative research focused on understanding views, experiences, beliefs and motivations
of individual participants (Kallio et al., 2016). This format allowed for consistency across
interviews while still enabling participants to express themselves freely and share unique
insights into the research topic. The open-ended nature of the questions allowed for flexibility
on the part of the interviewer and interviewee, while the structured elements allowed for
comparisons to be made between respondents and patterns to be identified. Semi-structured
interviews were also chosen because they help generate new questions and insights, particularly
valuable in exploratory studies (Qu and Dumay, 2011). The insights gathered did not only
contribute to answering the research question but also to refining the research objectives.
A structured interview guide (A.1) was developed in advance to ensure consistency across
participants.
The guide was organized into five main parts: (1) general background and
founding context, (2) AI usage across the five stages of the DT process (Empathize, Define,
Ideate, Prototype, and Test), (3) broader reflections on AI, (4) AI’s potential role as a co-founder,
and (5) closing reflections. A short section in between (1) and (2) also checked the participant’s
familiarity with the DT process. When necessary, a short explanation was provided by the
interviewers. While the guide served as a reference throughout, the interviews were conducted
in a flexible, conversational manner. Questions were not followed in a strict sequence or asked
uniformly across all participants, but were instead used selectively, based on the natural flow
of the conversation and the relevance of specific topics to each participant’s experience.
All interviews were conducted online via video call and were initially scheduled for one hour.
In practice, they typically lasted between 55 and 75 minutes, depending on the depth of the
participant’s answers, with one exception that lasted 45 minutes. This data was collected during
22

---

### Page 28

April and May of 2025. Interviews were audio-recorded with participant permission and later
transcribed verbatim. At the beginning of each session, participants were informed about the
nature and purpose of the study, the voluntary nature of their involvement, and the use of
recordings for analysis. They were also made aware that any data collected would be handled
anonymously, and that all identifying information would be removed during transcription.
Verbal consent was obtained for each participant in this exact manner.
3.2.6 Data Analysis Technique
The data collected in this study was analyzed using the Gioia methodology, a systematic
approach to inductive research that emphasizes thoroughness and traceability (Gioia et al.,
2013).
The analysis was done in three main stages. First, during the first-order coding phase, each
interview transcript was reviewed in full and relevant quotations were highlighted based on
their connection to the research question. Each of these quotes was then assigned a first-order
code using the researchers’ own words, forming a shortened version that still reflected the
participant’s meaning as closely as possible. If a quote related to a specific stage of the DT
process (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, or Test), that stage was also labeled explicitly
alongside the corresponding code. This labeling facilitated later pattern recognition across
interviews, enabled a more systematic comparison between DT stages, and ensured that the
final themes could be meaningfully linked back to the DT process. For each interview, between
15 and 55 first-order codes were created, resulting in a total of 298 first-order codes across all
nine interviews.
As many participants expressed essentially the same ideas, several of the resulting codes were
near-identical in meaning. To avoid redundancy and improve clarity, closely related first-order
codes were grouped together in the final presentation of the coding structure (A.2), while still
maintaining the nuance of individual perspectives.
In the second-order coding phase, all first-order codes were compared and clustered into a total
of 17 second-order themes. This step involved identifying patterns, differences, and underlying
meanings across interviews. The themes were developed inductively, but informed by the
study’s research question.
23

---

### Page 29

Finally, in the third stage, the second-order themes were grouped into five aggregate dimensions
based on their conceptual similarity or alignment.
These aggregate dimensions served to
structure the findings and represented the core constructs that answer the research question.
The entire coding process was done iteratively and involved several rounds of refinement.
Once the initial coding was complete, all levels of the coding structure were reviewed again to
check for logical consistency and alignment with participant perspectives. Adjustments were
made where necessary to ensure that the final analysis would accurately reflect the empirical
material. To enhance the reliability of the findings, coding was conducted independently by
two researchers. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion.
The complete coding structure, including all distinct first-order codes, second-order themes,
and aggregate dimensions, is presented in A.2. To provide an indication of the coding technique
used, a sample table is provided below.

3.3 Limitations
This research had several methodological limitations that should be acknowledged.
One
key limitation concerns the generalizability of the findings.
Because the study used a
non-probability sampling approach, participants were selected based on their relevance to
the research question rather than representativeness of a broader population. This sampling
approach also introduced selection bias, as the researchers’ judgment influenced who was
24

### Page 30

considered suitable. The reliance on existing networks may have further narrowed the range
of perspectives included. While efforts were made to ensure diversity across age, industry, and
geography, the small sample size also limits claims of theoretical saturation.
The semi-structured interview format, while offering both depth and flexibility, may have also
led to inconsistencies across interviews. Some questions were only asked when relevant to the
natural flow of the conversation, which may have affected comparability. Additionally, there
is a potential for observer bias if certain interviewer phrasing influenced participant responses,
despite efforts to maintain neutrality.
Lastly, the study relied solely on interviews. While appropriate for an exploratory abductive
approach, the absence of triangulation with other data sources (e.g. case studies) made it
difficult to validate findings from multiple perspectives. Nonetheless, these limitations are
acknowledged to ensure transparency and support the study’s credibility.
3.4 Ethical Considerations
This study was designed and conducted following established ethical standards for qualitative
research involving human participants. All participants were informed of the purpose of the
study, the voluntary nature of their participation, the use of audio recordings, and the intended
use of their data prior to the start of each interview. Verbal consent was obtained, as described
in detail in 3.2 “Data Collection.”
To protect participant privacy, all data was anonymized during transcription and analysis.
Names and identifying details were removed, and each participant was assigned a pseudonym.
The anonymized data was stored securely and only accessible to the researchers involved in
this study. Participants were informed that they could withdraw their consent at any time and
request the removal of their data. As a result of these measures, no conclusions could be drawn
about individual participants.
In line with the interpretivist and constructionist research philosophy guiding this study, the
researchers remained aware of and reflected on their own perspectives and potential influence
throughout the research process. While complete objectivity is not assumed in qualitative
research, care was taken to conduct interviews in a neutral manner.
The semi-structured
interview guide was followed flexibly to encourage conversations driven by the participant,
25

### Page 31

not the interviewer, while still maintaining focus on the research question to ensure relevant
data.
The data collection and analysis procedures were carefully designed to minimize ethical risks
such as social desirability bias or interviewer influence and ensure that findings emerged
solely from the collected material. This was done by framing questions openly and avoiding
judgmental language when creating the interview guide. Interviewees were encouraged to speak
freely, and their responses were treated with equal weight regardless of whether they aligned
with expectations.
Finally, the study emphasized transparency and academic integrity. The methodological design
and execution have been described in detail to allow for replicability.
Any limitations or
potential sources of bias are acknowledged, contributing to a clear and honest account of the
research process and its findings.
3.5 Trustworthiness of the Study
To ensure the trustworthiness of this research, the criteria proposed by Lincoln and Guba (1985)
were applied: credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability. Credibility was
strengthened through triangulation, using diverse participant perspectives and cross-checking
codes between two independent researchers.
Transferability was supported through thick
description, offering enough contextual detail for readers to assess the applicability of findings
to other settings. Dependability was addressed through a clear, iterative process with systematic
coding and thorough documentation of methodological decisions. Confirmability was also
strengthened by documenting choices, as well as through reflexivity, remaining aware of how
researcher bias may have influenced data collection and interpretation, while grounding all
findings in participant accounts. These measures collectively enhanced the study’s overall
trustworthiness and support future research in this field.

4.1 AI as an Accelerator and Scaler
A clear finding across all stages of the DT process was the acceleration brought about by AI, as
well as an expansion of the scale and scope of work in each stage. The Empathize and Define
stages show similar results, as both use AI to quickly acquire and go through data, significantly
accelerating research and data analysis processes.
Before AI was introduced, this stage often required extensive manual effort. Now, the same
tasks can be performed more efficiently. Interviewees described how AI expedites research
through rapid summarization, document analysis, and data scraping. It also offers novel ways to
scale user understanding. For example, it can run dozens of simulated interviews or process vast
amounts of user reviews, as Sofia mentions: “Before, I think it took me two weeks to interview,
let’s say, 10 people. Now, in one day, I can get 100 or 150 interviews”. Oliver mentioned that
“you can go through tens of thousands of data points within minutes”. Entrepreneurs widely
28

### Page 34

view AI as a transformative enabler of insight generation in the Empathize stage. Before AI,
many interviewees described empathizing with users as time-consuming “This took us almost a
week because it was so complex to do before”. As venture builder Daniel shared, ”I was going
through everything manually. This would usually take me a good three days.”, highlighting the
limitations of manual research before the introduction of tools like ChatGPT in late 2022.
The introduction of AI led to the concept of AI-enabled rapid exploration, where entrepreneurs
reported dramatic speed-ups. Johan stated it saved his company “countless hours or even days
of research”. Frank points out that tool functionalities like “deep research capabilities [in] the
whole LLMs [...][are] definitely a game changer” similar to Sofia, who also emphasized this, by
encouraging “anyone to get up to speed on a topic just by doing deep research with ChatGPT.”
Increased speed and scale during ideation emerged as another second-order theme in the
interviews. Frank, the venture builder who is deeply involved in the ideation stage of DT in
multiple projects, points out that his company uses a prompt chain as an “ideation tool that
speeds up the whole ideation process”. They can bring many more ideas to life in a much
shorter time and quickly validate them, increasing the scale and scope of ideas that go through.
Sofia mentions that it is ”mostly increasing speed and efficiency right now”, but not necessarily
quality, which will be explored in section 4.2.
According to the interviewees, the impact of AI has been significant in the prototyping
stage of DT. The emerging second-order theme of hyper-rapid prototyping and expanding
capabilities aligns with the aggregate dimension of increased speed and scale. Prototyping
has seen significant improvements in terms of speed and costs. As Daniel points out, ”the
development process is so much quicker and cheaper”, he says, crediting his co-founder for
building ”a product in two months at a cost that was previously close to 200.000€, and now
he builds it himself in two weeks with maybe a software cost of 200€”. Similarly, entrepreneur
Martin mentions “development times being reduced to a quarter of what it was”. The speed
has increased, and the necessary resources have decreased. Martin notes that ”it went from two
months and three people working on it to one month and one person quickly doing it”. Magnus,
Sofia, and Johan also point out as well that the prototyping stage has accelerated and shortened.
Sofia says that “a project that we sold took five months and now it’s a two month project”, and
Frank mentioned that “70% of the coding work is done by AI”. Product designer Erik pointed
out that, unlike the other interviewees, his prototypes are mostly physical, and the application of
29

---

### Page 35

AI to physical prototyping is limited: ”I keep things rudimentary and quick in the early stages.
I don’t think I have any AI tools that I would use for that”. Entrepreneur Magnus observes: ”I
often say speed has increased, but stability has decreased”, reflecting that a functioning product
still requires skilled work and that AI only helps with ‘quick and dirty’ prototyping.
Another second-order theme that emerged was accelerated testing with MVP-based
validation. As Erik explains, AI is mostly used for the testing stage, similar to the empathize
and define stage: ”[Tests] gather loads of data, and we’ll need to churn through it. So, when we
get to that point, we’ll probably be using ChatGPT”. Tests are now conducted using minimal
viable products that can be quickly produced during prototyping and provide better test results
through the use of higher-quality prototypes. Frank says “(...) you get so much better insights if
you show them the product that you are actually talking about rather than just philosophizing
about something and them having to guess how your product looks and how it potentially
works. This is what AI has definitely solved”. He adds that “the quality of feedback is just more
realistic”. Entrepreneur Johan said that using prototyping tools that extend your capabilities
helps you test different features quickly and iteratively. “Build products in two weeks, then
drop them onto the market and try to sell it. Because the best validation you can get is with the
product”, advised Johan, suggesting to validate directly with the product. He adds that, with
this speed, other stages could be skipped: ”Why would you empathize or do things like that?”
The impact of sped up processes is not only positive though, as Frank points out: “Sometimes
I miss out on the quality of some ideas that you develop because maybe the problem side is
not researched deeply enough and some things are not researched deeply enough”, taking a
cautious perspective on to the positive effects of the acceleration.
4.2 Impact on Creativity
The question of AI’s ability to think creatively and ‘outside the box’ emerged primarily in
discussions about the Ideation Stage of the DT process, as in this phase innovative solutions are
expected to surface. The interviewees feedback on this topic revealed two distinct perspectives.
On the one hand, AI leads to idea diversity and as an inspirational tool, on the other hand the
output itself often lacks novelty or creativity.
Idea inspiration and diversity were frequently emphasized by participants who descibed AI
as a powerful tool for broadening thinking and generating unexpected suggesstions. Martin
30

---

### Page 36

mentions that AI tools excel at uncovering blind spots and encouraging alternative perspectives,
prompting: ”Choose the opposing side and give me three ideas from that perspective. What
options am I missing?” . Following a similar approach, Sofia uses AI to generate ideas because
it ”makes you think about things you did not think about” and challenges your ideas., where “if
you prompt correctly, it can really help”. Johan described AI as a helpful facilitator to start the
creative process: “I like when I have kind of an idea and this idea generation with these tools
helps a lot”. The ability to build on existing ideas to further explore was also emphasized by
Erik, who uses AI extensively as an extension “to generate additional ideas”.
Besides serving as a jumpstarter for ideas, several interviewees voiced criticism regarding AI’s
actual creative capabilities, namely limited novelty and creativity. Daniel was particularly
blunt in his opinion that during ideation AI is “not very good in that” and that simply “for
generating business ideas its very bad” emphasizing on a lack of novelty and AI only generating
obvious and surface-level suggestions. Sofia supported this view, saying, ”AI tends to always
generate similar ideas”, and critiquing AI’s ability to think creatively or outside the box when
solving business problems. Similarly Martin said “our own brains are a lot better in finding
a real solution to a real problem than the AI is”, pointing to AI’s weakness in generating
conceptually new ideas. Viktor even said that the idea or solution should not be AI generated,
because it should come solely from a problem identified before.
4.3 Trust, Quality and Oversight
Although all of the interviewees recognize the value of AI-generated output, they consistently
emphasize the need for caution when working with AI. They highlight the importance of human
judgment and evaluation.
Daniel noted that, even when using AI to define a problem, the final output is still ”sort
of prioritized based on our gut feeling and experience”, particularly in the define stage.
Frank reiterated this call for human evaluation, stating that they still ”talk to real people and
double check with them” to validate the AI findings.
Entrepreneur Oliver mentioned that
decision-making is in his hand: “I’m making the call… Everything that is being output by AI
is human approved”. During the ideation stage, AI is only used to ”fine-tune all the ideas”
or ”trigger my own thought process”, as Martin said. This demonstrates the importance of
the human-in-the-loop because AI output alone cannot be relied on and must be verified by
31

---

### Page 37

humans. Real human input is also crucial during the testing stage. As Sofia pointed out, “you
need to test with humans” and use AI to synthesize test results, not replace real user interaction.
The need for human oversight was mentioned multiple times and was especially evident during
the prototyping stage. Although AI makes it easy to generate a quick, rough prototype, Frank
noted that one still needs ”some sort of technical knowledge [...] to go into the code and
program it further”. Oliver shared similar sentiments, saying that “the actual code that AI
writes is oftentimes breaking more than it is not”, commenting that the output still needs human
refinement. Entrepreneur Viktor echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that ”you still need proper
coders” to refine the product to a high standard. These perspectives summarize the necessity of
human technical oversight in refining AI-generated outputs, particularly during the product
creation process.
The need for oversight stems from a lack of trust and need for reliability and transparency
in AI outputs - an issue that was repeatedly raised by the interviewees. These concerns are
particularly evident in decision-making, as entrepreneur Martin says: “I trust it for 0% of any
decision. I don’t think AI will ever make business decisions”. He explains that he cannot trust
decisions that are not his own. The unclear reasoning behind decisions is causing distrust among
the founders, especially with generative AI models. Frank explains: “If I start brainstorming,
I trust the ideas quite a bit, but if it starts evaluating the idea: [Then I wonder] what are you
evaluating it based on?”. Johan echoed the same narrative noting: “you always need to be very
cautious and need to understand what the AI does, because you can’t trust an answer most of
the time.” Especially in high-stake areas like legal or financial advice, the doubts are evident,
as Johan pointed out. The interviewees mention though that this can be mitigated by better
prompting skills.
4.4 Entrepreneurial Adaption to AI Complexity
Entrepreneurship today faces a rapidly evolving AI landscape that demands both technical
adaptability and strategic implementation. As more tools are released and expectations rise,
those involved are forced to overcome steep learning curves, choose between multiple options,
and build custom workflows to stay competitive.
A key theme in how they navigate AI today is the learning curve to effective AI integration.
The interviewees often expressed a sense of being overwhelmed by the pace at which tools
32

---

### Page 38

and capabilities evolve. As Erik noted, “The difficulty is you’re constantly having to learn
something new every five minutes because someone has launched another tool”, reflecting on
the immense speed of technological advancements in the field of AI. For Sofia, learning AI
is an experimental, hands-on journey: ”You need to play around and learn”, emphasizing that
trial and error is essential. The urgency not to fall behind was also clear when she followed up
by saying: “I just think it’s really important – not only for startup founders, but for anyone in
general – to get used to using AI. Because if you don’t, you’re going to be left behind”. These
quotes illustrate how participants view AI learning as continuous and necessary.
This learning challenge is compounded by what can be described as an overloaded yet
underused AI tool landscape. Entrepreneurs are surrounded by a plethora of tools that promise
solutions, yet meaningful use remains difficult for many. “Everyone says they use it but… when
it comes to doing it they don’t really know”, noted Martin. Daniel added to this statement by
describing the current AI landscape as “a very much wild-west world now… Everyone still tries
to understand what the limits are”. This shows that despite the abundance of affordable tools,
few users get the most out of them.
In response, a lot of entrepreneurs are adapting by using their own customized AI-driven
workflows. Rather than relying on existing solutions alone, they develop tailored prompt
chains, custom GPTs [fine-tuned versions of OpenAI’s language models configured for specific
tasks; researcher’s clarification], or combine different tools to meet specific needs. As Venture
builder Daniel explained, “I have a custom GPT built for this… I just throw in the thing and
then it automatically analyzes exactly how I want it”. Others use specific tools in cross-platform
workflows to generate more precise inputs: “We use ChatGPT or other generative AI services
to give us good prompts.
(...)
that I then use in Lovable”, explained Viktor.
[Lovable
is a specialized AI-assisted coding tool designed to support developers with context-aware
suggestions and automation; researcher’s clarification]. Several participants emphasized that
the quality of AI output depends heavily on the quality of the input. As Sofia put it: “If you
don’t put in good data, you’ll get a bad outcome”. These examples show how participants create
personalized AI workflows and strategies by combining tools, refining prompts, and tailoring
systems.

4.5 Micro and Macro Impact
In the final identified dimension of the aggregate, the interviewees comment on their personal
reflections on the impact of AI at the various stages of the DT process in entrepreneurship.
Viktor believes that the accessibility of AI at various stages of the DT process sets a higher
standard: ”I think there is more competition because it’s become much easier to generate ideas.
More people will feel comfortable trying things with all the available AI tools. I think more
startups will appear, and better ones will emerge.” This kind of increased and accelerated
competition can lead to intensified competitive pressure on entrepreneurs, as Martin states
that he is ”a little bit more stressed because now the competition is doing nearly the same as
we do in regard to AI”. Sofia underscores this, stating that using AI is becoming the new norm
because all the competitors are doing the same: ”AI doesn’t help me be competitive because
all my competitors are doing the same”. Magnus also notes that ”expectations are higher”, not
only in terms of capabilities.
According to the interviewees, this perceived pressure stems from the evolution of
entrepreneurial ventures. The restructuring of processes, the democratization of capabilities,
and increased competition cause entrepreneurs to adapt their skill sets, as Martin mentions.
Furthermore, companies like venture builder Frank adopt an AI-first strategy, “implementing
AI as much as possible and wherever possible”.
Sofia is convinced that “in a very close
future (...) every company is creating their own AI”, showcasing the reshaping of business and
entrepreneurial structures. This will cause companies to “make the teams much smaller” as
Johan mentions.
Amid these broader shifts in entrepreneurial structures and strategies, the interviewees also
revealed how these transformations are mirrored on a deep and personal level. They mentioned
two such phenomena.
While they acknowledge a feeling of immense empowerment and
productivity gains, they also feel dependency, insecurity and stress about the influence of AI.
Product designer Erik is one of those who say AI empowers them. He says, “our income has
gone up probably 50% and I would lay that at the feet of AI”, whilst saying that he is “not
dependent at all. I am empowered”. Johan mentioned a similar experience, stating, ”I don’t
think I have become dependent on it, but I think I don’t want to get rid of it, because it helps
me stay so much more efficient”. Sofia echoes this sentiment, saying that she feels “empowered
34

---

### Page 40

because I can get quick answers, quick results in a very fast stimulating way”, but also dependent
“because all my job now is towards AI. You cannot go back to before”. Martin also admits that
it makes him ”feel a little dependent” on AI in DT and entrepreneurial processes.
The increased stress caused by sped up DT processes becomes evident in Sofia saying that “it
doesn’t make my job easier to be fair. It should make my job easier but somehow: no. Because
you go so fast that you are still super busy at the end of the day”. At the same time, she also
always feels behind, trying to catch up with the speed at which AI moves. This leads to sincere
frustration: “I’m always behind everything. It’s super frustrating. It’s going so fast, it’s crazy”.
Entrepreneur Oliver reflected about the dependency: “There was a very significant moment in
our founding when we as a team started to use AI for almost everything… and then you become
very reliant.”
4.5.1 Beyond the Personal Reflections: AI as a Co-Founder?
Beyond the research question of this thesis, all interviewees were asked about the claim that AI
can be considered a co-founder (A.1). When confronted with the statement, they did not entirely
agree that AI, in its current stage, can be considered a co-founder when going through the DT
stages in entrepreneurship. Daniel acknowledged AI’s capabilities and described it as ”your
first employee”, emphasizing its role in supporting small teams. Magnus referred to it as ”a
junior”, and Johan noted, ”It’s not a co-founder, but I see it more as a consultant”. also does not
think it is a Co-Founder, yet regarding the quick development of AI, he stated: ”I am confident
it will reach co-founder ability within the next couple of months or years.” Entrepreneur Viktor
pointed out that a lack of human diversity in a relationship with a co-founder is something
lacking with AI. He stated that ”there are so many other factors that an individual or a human
co-founder gives that AI cannot”. In a similar tone, Martin said that “It does not replace a
co-founder because it doesn’t have skin in the game“.

5 Analysis and Discussion
This chapter analyzes the study’s findings in relation to the research question and literature. The
first section examines how AI influences activities throughout the DT process, while the second
section explores the challenges and strategies that emerge from AI’s practical application. The
chapter concludes with a synthesized discussion including a conceptual model, as well as
theoretical and practical implications.
5.1 Impact of AI on Design Thinking Activities
In this section the findings of the first two aggregate dimensions are put into context and
discussed.
5.1.1 Findings 1: AI as an Accelerator and Scaler
Across all five stages of the DT process, AI emerged as both an accelerator and scaler,
streamlining tasks and enabling faster iterations. Findings show dramatic speed improvements
in data analysis, user research and MVP development, scaled through automation and
large-scale data processing.
Interviewees mention that in the Empathize stage, AI
semi-automates time-intensive discovery, enabling early customer understanding via sentiment
analysis, review scraping, or simulated interviews. In the Define stage the faster synthesis of
insights is evident when analyzing big amounts of collected data, using pattern recognition
for identifying pain points, a time-intensive task previously done manually. Such automation
aligns with Obschonka and Audretsch’s (2020) claims of accelerated opportunity recognition
and Verganti et al. (2020) emphasis on improved and more user centered approaches regarding
empathy in early-stage innovation due to AI. Even though Cautela et al. (2019) and Townsend
and Hunt (2019) observed classical AI algorithms aiding research and problem definition
before the advent of AI tools like ChatGPT, their findings are even more pronounced today.
In the Ideation stage, a prompt-chain setup, as mentioned in the interviews, can compress the
time frame, and AI’s ability to take different roles supports developing solutions outside the
original scope, a finding backed by Davidsson and Sufyan (2023). For Prototyping and Testing,
the interviewees mention that no-code tools or programming AIs help build quick MVPs that
can be tested by real people immediately, increasing the quality of the testing insights, leading
36

---

### Page 42

to reduced cost and time, as well as more experimentation cycles and earlier market feedback.
Quicker building and validation has been a common theme among the interviewees, supporting
a study by Vecchiarini and Somià (2023). However, one participant noted that AI’s impact
on accelerating prototyping is industry-dependent, with significantly less influence in physical
product development than in digital contexts, an aspect not further explored in the reviewed
literature. Additionally, AI tools enhance the ability to collect and process large amounts of
data, such as test results, which is also supported by the findings of Shepherd and Majchrzak
(2022). While Chalmers et al. (2021) highlight AI’s potential to accelerate testing through the
generation of user insights, the interviews revealed no evidence of such advancements. In fact,
the interviewees hinted that manual user input is still required and that synthetic testing is not
popular.
Examining the entire DT process, the findings generally align with those of Chalmers
et al. (2021) and Giuggioli and Pellegrini (2023), emphasizing AI’s potential to scale
entrepreneurship significantly and efficiently through AI-enabled approaches.
They also
confirm the prediction of Obschonka and Audretsch (2020) that AI will have a disruptive
impact in speeding up entrepreneurial processes, to which DT is often applied. However,
some participants cautioned against over-relying on speed at the expense of depth, a point only
briefly touched upon by Cautela et al. (2019).
AI used to be limited to data-intensive industries, where classical algorithms performed well
(Townsend and Hunt, 2019; Obschonka and Audretsch, 2020), but now spans nearly all areas
of entrepreneurship.
5.1.2 Findings 2: Impact on Creativity
For the impact on creativity, the findings in the Ideation stage are of most interest. On the
one hand interviewees voiced that AI stimulated ideation and served as a source of inspiration,
supporting Figoli et al.’s (2022) view of AI as an early-stage collaborator in idea development.
Boussioux et al. (2024) and Girotra et al. (2023) similarly share participants’ view on AI’s
high-quality, valid output, which can be achieved by making use of AI’s capabilities to take
different roles or asking to challenge existing thinking. This matches the findings from the
interviews, where participants described prompting AI to take roles or critique ideas from varied
perspectives.
37

---

### Page 43

While Boussioux et al. (2024) and Girotra et al. (2023), acknowledge the high quality and
viability in AI ideas, both state that AI underperforms on novelty and originality, a theme that
also emerged in the interviews. Doshi and Hauser (2023) additionally concluded that AI boosts
idea quality, but narrows creative diversity. When tasked with originating ideas independently,
AI often fails to produce contextually rich, surprising, or bold innovations, which are traits
critical in entrepreneurship. This supports the view of Verganti et al. (2020), who argue that
AI cannot replace the human in defining creative direction, and echoed by entrepreneur Martin,
who repeatedly said human brains are better at finding creative solutions than AI.
Interviewees found AI most useful as a creative companion that triggers human creativity rather
than producing novel insights independently. This concept was further specified by the findings
of the third aggregate dimension, ”Human-AI Collaboration,” and Yu’s (2025) view of AI as a
creative stimulus.
The effectiveness of AI also seemed to depend heavily on how it was used, calling for prompting
skills and human intervention. Boussioux et al. (2024) suggest assigning expert roles to AI to
enhance output novelty to a more human-like level. This approach is echoed by interviewees
saying that if you prompt correctly, the output increases a lot, emphasizing on the growing
importance of prompt engineering.
5.1.3 Discussion: Impact of AI on Design Thinking Activities
As evidenced by the previous sections, AI is reshaping the DT process by impacting discrete
activities and has the potential to reconfigure how the process unfolds.
The following
discussion synthesizes these insights in relation to the existing literature and explores emerging,
process-wide patterns and implications.
The findings demonstrate that AI both scales and compresses the time frame of each DT stage,
reducing the overall cycle time. This supports and extends prior work on AI in entrepreneurship
(Obschonka and Audretsch, 2020; Chalmers et al., 2021; Giuggioli and Pellegrini, 2023),
particularly in terms of enhanced efficiency and the ability to explore broader problem spaces
(Townsend and Hunt, 2019). Importantly, AI not only reinforces the fluid movement between
stages as previously noted by Verganti et al. (2020), but amplifies it, particularly between the
“Empathize-Define” and “Prototype-Test” stages. This has resulted in more iterative, seamless
transitions and continuous learning loops (Yu, 2025). It is worth noting that AI’s impact appears
38

---

### Page 44

to be influenced by industry context, with digital products being naturally more compatible due
to AI’s inherently digital nature. A novel finding is the occasional skipping of stages (e.g.
for direct MVP validation), something not addressed in existing literature and hinting at new
behavior within the DT framework.
AI’s dual role in creativity, both as a catalyst and as a constraint, becomes particularly evident
in the Ideate stage. While using AI as an inspirational stimulus (Yu, 2025) and sparring partner
evolves, the limitations in the originality of the output are apparent and nurture scepticism
among the interviewees. The found data does not show a binary view that AI is either helpful
or harmful to creativity by showing that its value is situational and only fully effective when
paired with human intention, oversight, and refinement. This highlights a central paradox in
AI-assisted creativity: AI accelerates ideation but, without skilled use, may undermine the
originality of the creative process.
5.2 Challenges and Strategies in AI Integration
This section discusses the findings of the aggregate dimensions 4.3, 4.3 and 4.5.
5.2.1 Findings 3: Trust, Quality and Oversight
Many participants expressed skepticism toward the output of AI when using it across stages
of the DT process. While AI was widely appreciated as a productivity enhancer and thought
stimulator, participants consistently emphasized that its outputs must be validated and
contextualized by human judgment. This aligns with existing literature that positions AI as
an augmentative force that requires technical refinement and oversight, rather than being fully
autonomous (Chalmers et al., 2021). Verganti et al. (2020) and Yu (2025) argue that while AI
can help automating certain activities, humans remain essential for sense-making and defining
what actually matters.
This ‘human-in-the-loop’ was considered especially crucial to maintain reliability when AI
outputs were used to inform important business directions or customer-facing decisions. Even
when AI performed well, its lack of transparency caused discomfort, as outputs could not
always be explained or traced, requiring additional validation.
Shepherd and Majchrzak
(2022) similarly state that this issue complicates accountability in decision-making processes.
Furthermore, Figoli et al. (2022) and Vecchiarini and Somià (2023) stress that AI must be
39

---

### Page 45

interpreted with caution, as blind trust can compromise outcomes.
Participants’ concerns about quality control, leading to an increased risk of instability, was
however contradicted by some literature.
Figoli et al. (2022) described AI as a reliable
teammate during early design stages, while the data complicates this description by showing
that participants did not perceive reliability as an intrinsic component of current AI tools.
This skepticism also contrasts to optimistic statements from Dellermann et al. (2019) and
Giuggioli and Pellegrini (2023), who propose that AI can serve as a decision-support partner
in entrepreneurship. These dynamics reflect the intricacies of Jeremiah’s (2025) ’human-AI
dyad’, in which entrepreneurial decision-making is increasingly shaped by an evolving balance
between human judgment and machine output.
5.2.2 Findings 4: Entrepreneurial Adaption to AI Complexity
The growing complexity of the AI landscape created several challenges for participants. While
they are actively adapting to ensure they are able to integrate AI effectively into their work,
doing so requires a steep learning curve. Jeremiah (2025) adds to this by saying AI literacy
is no longer just advantageous but becoming more and more essential when adopting AI, a
sentiment echoed by many participants. Yu (2025) also states that entrepreneurial teams must
learn to interpret algorithmic outputs to ensure relevant data.
This challenge is amplified by the constant release of new tools, leading many users to only
scratch the surface of AI’s capabilities without fully understanding or leveraging them. This
highlights a gap between availability and effective application. The theoretical framework of
this study does not explicitly cover this saturation effect, nor the resulting cognitive overload,
as this is a finding not initially anticipated.
Building customized AI-driven workflows to fit specific venture-specific tasks, a way for
participants to navigate this complexity with adaptive capability, is also an unexpected finding
and therefore not covered in the framework. Obschonka et al. (2024) do discuss the emerging
role of entrepreneurs as prompt designers, shifting their role from creation to curation. The
data extends that idea: prompt engineering and rich contextual input were mentioned as critical
success factors, with many noting that an LLM’s creative quality rises or falls with the precision
of its prompts. Despite the importance put on it by participants, the value of good prompting
remains largely under-discussed in the literature reviewed, signaling a notable gap between

scholarly attention and entrepreneurial reality.
5.2.3 Findings 5: Micro and Macro Impact
Interviewees portrayed AI as a double-edged sword in their entrepreneurial lives. On the one
hand, aligning with research from Giuggioli and Pellegrini (2023) and Jeremiah (2025), widely
accessible tools have accelerated productivity and enhanced individual capabilities, which gives
them a feeling of empowerment and tangible performance gains (e.g. faster results, higher
income). On the other hand, in line with Samal et al.’s (2024) findings, the same accessibility
has increased competition. Obschonka et al. (2024) attribute this, in part, to the fact that AI
has made prototyping available to everyone, no matter their experience, democratizing this
previously challenging and time-consuming step from concept to market-ready product. This
statement clearly aligns with participants’ sentiments, as explained in section 5.1.1.
Yet AI’s momentum has also created downsides, with most participants reporting growing
dependency as their work becomes inseparable from it. Yu (2025) warns that cognitive overload
and dependency on AI may hinder creativity and result in a passive mindset when engaging in
entrepreneurial DT, a danger participants appeared to be well aware of. Interestingly, only
product designer Erik felt no dependency on AI, probably moderated by his long pre-AI career.
Other feelings of stress and insecurity, highlighted multiple times by participants, cannot be
aligned with the reviewed literature.
In addition, participants were asked directly whether AI could be considered a co-founder.
While they all acknowledged that it is incredibly useful for optimizing their workflow, none
were fully convinced it could be seen as equal to a human co-founder. This reflects Davidsson
and Sufyan (2023) research stating that AI lacks the intuition, contextual awareness, and
risk-taking role critical to founding ventures. Participants’ description of AI’s role in start-ups
as their “first employee”, “junior” or “consultant”, emphasizes this further. These views are
also in line with Verganti et al. (2020), who position AI as an augmentative force in innovation,
not an autonomous individual with all the necessary entrepreneurial capabilities.
5.2.4 Discussion: Challenges and Strategies in AI Integration
The second part of the research question explored the challenges and strategies emerging in the
practical application of AI across entrepreneurial DT. The findings reveal not just technical or
41

### Page 47

cognitive obstacles, but a nuanced interplay of trust, skill, and adaptation.
At the center of this interplay is the persistent distrust in AI outputs. AI’s “black-box” nature
results for many in a concerning lack of trust and transparency, confining it to more of an
advisory role, where it is allowed to give suggestions without having actual control. Participants
gladly exploit its speed and volume, but its technological capability matters little if users
doubt their reliability. To bridge that trust gap, users have created a human-in-the-loop layer.
This means they are constantly double-checking AI output with real customers or themselves,
depending on the specific activity, confirming Vecchiarini and Somia’s (2023) call for human
oversight.
Keeping up with the constant release of new AI tools only adds to the complexity. Participants
described there being a tool for everything nowadays, making it difficult to keep up and
impossible for many to exploit the capabilities of AI tools to its full extent. This learning
curve makes AI literacy a new source of competitive differentiation: those who, per Jeremiah’s
(2025), actively cultivate literacy, and master skills such as prompt designing (Obschonka et al.,
2024) and creating custom tools, move beyond generic outputs to venture-specific insights. AI
literates show a more intentional and embedded use of AI, where tools are configured around
the task rather than the task adapting to the tool.
Furthermore, the data shows that ventures, like individuals, are adapting to integrate AI into
their structures. Ventures have started creating their own AI policies and tools, and restructuring
teams around smaller, AI-augmented cores.
As employees deepen their understanding of
AI, micro-level practice changes appear to accumulate into macro-level, organizational
transformation. This evolution is largely absent from the framework, representing an empirical
extension that suggests that AI’s influence goes further than individual tasks.
Entrepreneurial competition intensifies as a result of these individual and venture-level shifts.
Because ‘everyone is doing the same’, presumed advantages are suddenly not advantageous
anymore when some individuals are more capable of using AI than others.
This fuels
the stress and feeling of dependency many interviewees reported. Paradoxically, the same
tools that empowers entrepreneurial design thinkers by enhancing productivity, also increases
psychological load.
They feel anxious about falling behind and feel uneasy about how
inseparable their everyday work has become from AI. The data, however, hints that prior
industry experience can act as a dependency buffer, suggesting that the psychological impact
42

---

### Page 48

of AI is amplified among those who lack confidence in their pre-AI abilities. To build on
that feeling of insecurity, many find themselves pushed into faster cycles by marker pressure
rather than by choice. This increased pace doesn’t reduce the workload, it simply means more
cycles get completed in the same timeframe, moving the pressure from execution to continuous
improvement.
Finally, the co-founder question highlights an important distinction between AI and human
entrepreneurs: while AI can take on many operational tasks, participants reserve the term
“co-founder” for those that share risk, responsibility, and vision. Since these traits were not
attributed to current AI tools by participants, AI was ultimately seen as a valuable assistant
rather than an equal partner in new venture creation.
These findings indicate that while AI usage promises empowerment, its full potential depends
heavily on human skill, interpretation, and strategic adaptation. This dynamic may be even
more influential than the technology itself.
5.3 General Discussion and Implications
This section addresses the overarching research question guiding this study: How does artificial
intelligence affect the activities involved in the design thinking process in entrepreneurship, and
what challenges and strategies emerge in its practical application? Building on the findings
and their individual analysis and discussion (Section 5.1 and 5.2), this section generalizes
those insights to offer a process-wide interpretation of how AI transforms entrepreneurial
design thinking. Section 5.3.1 introduces a synthesized model visualizing a key insight of
this study. 5.3.2 then outlines the implications resulting from this research. As the research
question inherently combines practical application with conceptual exploration, some practical
implications are already embedded in the synthesized discussion.
5.3.1 Interpretive Summary and Conceptual Model
After examining how AI affects activities in the DT process, the following can be said. Across
all stages, speed and scale is dramatically increased. Individuals feel significantly empowered
by being able to move faster, iterate more, and operate at a broader scope. However, these
benefits are not without trade-offs. Challenges like limited creativity or trust issues quickly
emerge when using AI without proper supervision. Individuals who use AI for entrepreneurial
43

DT are very much aware of this, and therefore insist on human-AI collaboration, where human
input, judgment, intuition, and strategic oversight remain critical for quality outcomes.
This collaboration becomes especially important as AI-generated outputs often lack depth and
originality. However, when paired with human insight and used thoughtfully, AI can greatly
enhance creativity, but this requires new skills.
AI literacy, which encompasses strategic
prompting, tool fluency, the ability to build custom workflows, and critical interpretation, is
becoming a key differentiator in venture output and performance. But developing such literacy
is complex and time-intensive, often leading to the feeling of always being behind.
Moreover, where once adopting AI was a source of competitive advantage, it is now expected.
The quality of usage, not just usage itself, has now become the new competitive edge. This
necessity to adapt fuels dependency, as the more proficient they become, the more embedded
AI becomes in their daily work. This has in turn led to a sense of insecurity in their own
capabilities and general unease about how reliant they have become, a feeling less prevalent
in those with significant pre-AI work experience. On a venture level, this is reflected in the
implementation of AI-first strategies and custom tools or workflows, further deepening this
dependence. Overall, AI serves as a powerful tool for innovation through the augmentation of
human capabilities, but meaningful outcomes only emerge when it is harnessed and steered by
human involvement.
In AI-driven DT, this human involvement shifts across stages depending on the type of input
each stage relies on. The stages Empathize, Ideate, and Test have traditionally always depended
heavily on external human input, such as user behavior, feedback, and creative thinking. With
the integration of AI, humans must stay directly involved to provide this input. AI can assist
by processing large volumes of data or generating idea prompts, but its outputs require active
validation, judgment, and creativity to ensure relevance and originality. While Empathize and
Test rely on humans to validate and interpret user-related insights, Ideate requires humans to
look beyond AI suggestions and use it as an inspiration trigger for more creative ideas.
In contrast, the stages Define and Prototype have traditionally always relied on internally
synthesized inputs developed in earlier stages. When using AI in these stages, humans are
crucial for supervision. AI can help identify patterns or generate prototypes quickly, but humans
provide the strategic oversight needed to ensure alignment with goals, feasibility, and quality.
In Define, this means using judgment to interpret insights and ensure the right problem is being
44

### Page 50

framed. In Prototype, it involves guiding and refining AI-generated outputs to meet practical
and technical requirements. While both require oversight, Define centers on decision-making
and direction-setting, whereas Prototype focuses on hands-on refinement and implementation.
DT is traditionally described as a human-centered approach to innovation. With the integration
of AI, this is still the case.
However, the meaning of “human-centered” has evolved.
It
no longer refers only to designing with the user in mind, but also to centering the human
within the process for their creativity, ethical judgment, contextual understanding, technical
expertise, and oversight necessary when working with AI. Seen through this lens, the human
role becomes more dynamic and varied across the DT stages.
Human judgment remains
essential, but its specific form evolves: from hands-on engagement in externally-facing stages
to strategic direction and refinement in internally-focused ones. This highlights a nexus between
human-in-the-loop (participatory) and human-on-the-loop (supervisory) roles, reinforcing that
meaningful human-AI collaboration is not static, but adaptive and stage-specific.
The following model (Fig. 2) visualizes the above described insight from this study. Rather
than aiming to answer the entire research question, the model captures the nuanced shifts in
collaboration dynamics across the DT process. The five circular loops depict each stage, with
the human being either in the loop or on the loop, while the connecting arrows emphasize
the iterative nature of the framework. Underneath each loop, the corresponding role of AI
is shown, as well as the type of input required, highlighting how data sources have an effect
on the role of both humans and AI. The model is meant to guide a more intentional integration
of AI into entrepreneurial DT by clarifying where human creativity, judgment, or oversight is
most essential for effective collaboration and quality outcomes.

5.3.2 Implications
Theoretical Implications
The study makes a significant theoretical contribution by deepening the understanding of AI’s
impact on entrepreneurial innovation literature, especially in the context of DT. It expands
prior research by demonstrating nuanced interactions between AI-driven acceleration, creative
constraints, and dependency phenomena. This challenges overly optimistic portrayals of AI’s
role in fostering creativity (Girotra et al., 2023; Yu, 2025) and highlights the evolving human-AI
partnership.
A central theoretical contribution is the proposed “Human-AI Collaboration across the Design
Thinking Stages in Entrepreneurship” model. The framework presents a novel perspective on
the adjusted human role and the impact on activities along the DT process as a result of the
integration of AI, paving the way for further research.
This paper definitively confirms the theoretical framework’s theme that AI accelerates the DT
stages and broadens the scope in entrepreneurship. Since the technology studied is novel and
advances rapidly, findings can become outdated quickly. However, this study confirms the
findings of earlier studies, suggesting that the proposed results can be applied to the newer
and more accessible kind of AI. This research also touches upon the tensions between AI’s
probabilistic, data driven nature and DT’s human-centered abductive methods. The observed
trust issues towards AI outputs among participants illustrates that individuals are aware of its
46

### Page 52

inherent flaws, and are able to address them in such a way that radical innovation is still possible.
The findings advance the theoretical understanding of a reconfigured DT process, confirming
and extending the prior work of Yu (2025) and Verganti et al. (2020). The observed stage
convergence and stage skipping, as well as the adjusted human role in the DT process, hint
at a shift in the logic and architecture of the DT framework when augmented by AI. Building
on the findings of Obschonka et al. (2024), AI literacy emerges as a key entrepreneurial skill,
offering a refined understanding of how to overcome challenges and develop adaptive strategies
throughout the process.
Finally, the study confirms the positive impact of AI within the studied context.
It lends
support to Obschonka and Audretsch’s (2020) prediction that AI will disrupt entrepreneurship.
Notably, it responds to Cautela et al.’s (2019) request for in-depth interview research on AI and
DT in entrepreneurship. The proposed model offers a nuanced perspective on their concerns
regarding a shift in creativity and human-centered validation. It suggests reconfigurations rather
than replacement of the human. Overall, this research provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the application of AI to the DT process in entrepreneurship that future research
can build upon.
Practical Implications
This study aims to offer guidance on how AI can be integrated into the DT process in
entrepreneurship to maximize value without compromising depth of quality and creativity.
The research shows that optimal results are not accomplished with full automation, but from
thoughtful human-AI collaboration. Individuals who use DT in entrepreneurship should treat
AI as a tool that enhances their own capabilities, rather than replacing them. To integrate AI
effectively, individuals must become AI literate, including the ability to prompt strategically,
evaluate outputs critically and adapt existing tools, or create new ones, to their venture’s specific
needs. While AI can support every stage in the DT process, applying it effectively demands
stage-specific strategies, shortly explained below.
• Empathize: Utilize AI for breadth of research (e.g., sentiment analysis, online reviews
scraping, deep research) while preserving human-led deep qualitative interactions and
interpretation to maintain empathy depth, ensuring user needs are understood beyond
surface-level quantitative data.
47

### Page 53

• Define: Employ AI to cluster insights, summarize interview findings, and detect patterns.
Human expertise is critical to interpret meaning, judge relevance, and frame the problem
accurately, preventing misalignment between insights and real user needs.
• Ideate: Use AI as a creative companion via prompt chains or role-based ideation. Let it
generate unexpected directions, while humans curate, combine, and refine outputs. This
is to ensure genuinely novel ideas through the injection of cultural relevance, originality,
and feasibility.
• Prototype:
Utilize AI to quickly generate digital wireframes, code, and interface
mock-ups, accelerating early-stage development. Human oversight remains essential to
guide functionality, ensure stability and quality, and align prototypes with user needs and
venture goals.
• Test: Employ AI to synthesize feedback, identify recurring themes, and structure findings
efficiently. However, meaningful insights still rely on human interpretation of reactions,
emotional cues, and contextual subtleties to preserve the richness of user validation.

6 Conclusion
6.1 Concluding Summary
Given the underexplored interaction between artificial intelligence (AI) and innovation methods
like Design Thinking (DT) in entrepreneurship, this study was motivated by the need to
examine their complex and evolving relationship, research especially called for by Cautela
et al. (2019). It therefore explored how AI affects the activities involved in the DT process
in entrepreneurship, and what challenges and strategies emerge in its practical application.
This study used a qualitative approach to explore the research topic, drawing insights from
interviews with relevant individuals, and ultimately revealing five key dimensions that offer
a structured understanding of the phenomena under investigation.
Findings show that AI
accelerates and scales activities across all stages, leading to a significant compression of the
traditional DT cycle, by empowering individuals to work faster and more broadly. This supports
and extends previous work by Cautela et al. (2019), Giuggioli and Pellegrini (2023) and Yu
(2025), who found that AI enhances both efficiency and supports more informed and data-driven
decision-making processes.
However, these advantages simultaneously come with several
dangers: overall low trust in AI output, loss of depth in user understanding, reduced creativity,
AI dependency, and the pressure of keeping up. Therefore, users actively position themselves in
a participatory or supervisory role, depending on the stage, to ensure quality outcomes. In turn,
this has led to the emergence of AI literacy as a new and essential skill. This evolving dynamic
is illustrated in a visual model developed in this study, highlighting the shifting human-AI roles
across the DT process. As the field evolves, future research could investigate the robustness
of these findings. In addition to the model, the study offers both theoretical implications and
practical guidance on how to integrate AI in ways that enhance, rather than hurt, entrepreneurial
outcomes.
Finally, circling back to the question posed at the beginning of this study – “Can AI serve as a
co-founder in modern entrepreneurship?” – it concludes that the metaphor, while compelling
in media and startup rhetoric, remains aspirational rather than operational.

6.2 Limitations
While this work provides valuable insights into the interplay of AI and the DT process in
entrepreneurship, certain limitations based on its design and execution should be acknowledged.
First, the scope and generalizability of the findings is limited by the qualitative methodology
and the characteristics of the sample.
With a total of nine participants, selected through
purposive and convenience sampling, with similar geographical, industry and age background,
the findings provide deep insights, but can not be statistically generalized to the broader
population. The sample selected is able to provide a small insight into their day-to-day life,
which lays the groundwork for the proposed findings.
Second, the cross-sectional nature of this research only offers insights into a specific period of
time. Due to the rapid and continuous evolution of AI, the findings only reflect the landscape
at that time. Related to the rapidly advancing technology, another limitation is the limited tool
coverage, caused by the large number of tools and the small participant sample.
6.3 Future Research
Building on the findings and addressing the limitations, this study opens several options for
future research into AI’s transformative role in entrepreneurial design thinking.
Firstly, triangulating these findings through quantitative or mixed-methods approaches would
be beneficial. Quantitative studies could offer statistically reliable results drawn from more
diverse samples of individuals involved in DT in entrepreneurship. This could lead to a higher
generalizability of the qualitative themes identified in this work. Mixed methods research
could combine the depth of qualitative inquiry with the breadth of quantitative data to explore
correlations between AI adoption patterns, AI literacy levels, and background factors.
Secondly, a longitudinal study could track how entrepreneurs and others involved in the process
interact with AI tools over time, and how human-AI collaboration evolves. This would enhance
understanding of adoption abilities, creativity changes, and long-term shifts in entrepreneurial
skill sets impacting DT outcomes.
The proposed “Human-AI collaboration across the Design Thinking Stages” model
provides a foundation that warrants further empirical testing, validation and refinement.

### Page 56

Future research could examine how this model performs across contexts and how
human-in-the-loop/on-the-loop roles change as AI becomes more advanced.
Other unexpected themes found in this study could also be studied on their own, such as the
speed-versus-depth dilemma, the role of AI literacy, or the empowerment–dependency paradox.
Lastly, similar to what the participants of this study experienced in their personal lifes, these
findings also suffer from the rapid development in AI. Repeating this study in the future could
therefore add valuable longitudinal insights. Another possible direction is comparing outcomes
of AI-driven DT processes with traditional DT, investigating the results, and turning them into
a comparative analysis.

Can you tell me a bit about your background and your current role in your startup or venture?
1.2 Founding Timeline (if founder)
When did you start your current venture?
What motivated you to start your business?
2. Exploring the Design Thinking Stages
2.0 Familiarity with Design Thinking
Are you familiar with the design thinking process and its five stages (Empathize, Define, Ideate,
Prototype, Test)?
(If not: explain shortly)
2.1 Empathize
How did you first discover the need or problem that your business aims to solve?
What methods did you use to understand your users/customers early on? (e.g., interviews,
observation)
Did AI play any role in helping you understand or analyze your audience?
2.2 Define
Once you had some user insights, how did you narrow it down to a specific problem to solve?
Did AI assist you in synthesizing data or shaping a clearer problem definition?
2.3 Ideate
How did you generate ideas for solving the problem?
Did you use any AI tools to brainstorm or come up with creative concepts?
Were you able to explore more ideas or perspectives than you would have alone?

2.4 Prototype
Once you had a promising idea, how did you start testing it? Did you create mockups, MVPs,
or other prototypes?
Were there any AI tools that helped you create or improve your prototype?
2.5 Test
How did you test your prototype or solution with users?
What kinds of feedback did you collect, and how?
Did AI assist in collecting or analyzing user feedback?
3. Broader Reflections on AI

A.2 Coding Overview
This appendix presents a structured overview of the coding process used in the analysis. The
data is organized into the five aggregate dimensions, each broken down into corresponding
second-order themes and first-order codes, displayed in a table format per dimension. Where
relevant, the first-order codes include in parentheses the first letter of the Design Thinking stage
(Empathize (E), Define (D), Ideate (I), Prototype (P) or Test (T)) to indicate the specific context
in which the code was mentioned.

A.3 Accounting for Generative AI Use
In this appendix, we acknowledge to what degree AI tools have been used in the writing of this
thesis. It will list the tools used and state the type of usage.
1. Tools: ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, NotebookLM, DeepL
2. Degrees of Use: Generative AI Chat tools were used as an aid in the writing of the thesis.
Perplexity Deep Research was used to gather an overview of the literature landscape.
NotebookLM was utilized to research papers on a deeper level. While the results helped
to gain a first overview, the literature review was done manually using Scopus. ChatGPT
and Gemini were used to critique written sections and provide feedback on how to
improve them throughout the thesis. It is important to note that all ideas and concepts
in this thesis are the authors’ own and not the result of AI tools. AI chat tools were also
used to answer questions about structuring topics and improving the reader’s experience.
Although the coding was done manually, similar to the rigor of this entire document, the
AI tools assessed the outcomes for thoroughness and completeness. Lastly, DeepL Write
was used to improve sentence structure, vary word choice, and fix grammatical errors.
The authors attribute the scientific work in this paper entirely to their own efforts and take full
ownership and accountability of the outcomes. They do not accredit it to the outcomes of AI
tools.
