Niantic Labs and the Professional Entrepreneur in the 
Silicon Valley: Google, Pokémon Go, and Beyond 
(Consolidated) 
You can be the subject of a strategic inflection point 
but you can also be the cause of one. 
 
—ANDREW S. GRO VE 
 FO RMER CEO AN D CO-F OUNDE R, INTEL 
 
On a sunny Monday afternoon in late summer 2019, as hundreds of commuters, tourists, and 
consumers scurried about their daily business on the ground floor of the landmark 114-year-old 
Ferry Building along San Francisco’s Embarcadero—making connections to the local ferries, 
enjoying a midday coffee, or visiting the boutique food shops—little did they suspect that right 
above them, on the building’s second floor, a small but rapidly-growing company had already 
reached a secure beachhead in the future of augmented reality (AR). Many technology observers 
believed that this still-nascent industry was destined to become “the next big thing,” with 
combined AR and VR (virtual reality) spending expected to grow from $26.7 billion in 2018 to 
$814.7 billion in 2025 worldwide.1 
 
The company, Niantic Labs, had spun out of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, in November 
2015, after being established as a standalone unit within Google in 2010 by John Hanke (Exhibit 
1) to look at what opportunities may exist at the “intersection of mobile, geo, social, and gaming.” 
Its third and most recent game, Pokémon Go (Exhibit 2)—launched after its Alphabet spin-out in 
July 2016, with Nintendo and the Pokémon Company becoming equity partners—allowed users 
to score points by capturing any one of the 800+ virtual Pokémon characters available. In all 
three of its AR apps, Niantic sought to differentiate itself from other AR and virtual reality (VR)

game makers by placing an emphasis on “exploration, exercise, and social” as its mission and 
goals for each of its games.2 By early 2019, Pokémon Go was the most popular AR game 
globally with one billion downloads.3 
 
Within a few days of its U.S. release on July 6, 2016, Pokémon Go had an estimated 28.5 million 
daily unique users,4 an estimated 5 percent of all Android users had downloaded the game;5 and 
an estimated 60 percent of all those who downloaded it, played daily.6 Beyond this initial 
success, Niantic had accomplished a fairly unique strategic success by materially extending the 
user engagement and thereby the economic game life of Pokémon Go, through a novel series of 
outdoor “Fests” and “Community Days” that attracted tens of thousands, and sometimes hundreds 
of thousands of game players in collaborative outdoor celebrations and game play. Indeed, as 
recently as August 2019, Pokémon Go had “climbed [back] to the No.1 on the list of top-grossing 
mobile games.”7 Additionally, a Duke University researcher estimated that were health benefits to 
playing Pokémon Go, with players averaging 2,000 more steps daily.8 
 
Now Niantic was at an inflection point. While the company had just released “Harry Potter: 
Wizards Unite!” in conjunction with Warner Bros. and author J.K. Rowling in summer 2019, 
Hanke and his executive team were already thinking about the “now, near, and far” horizons of 
where Niantic might be in a few months, years, and even decades. The company had just raised 
$200 million in a Series C round of equity financing led by IVP in December 2018 from several 
strategic partners, including Samsung Electronics and aXiomatic Gaming,9 that gave it a market 
valuation of nearly $4 billion.1011 By the end of May 2019, Niantic was ranked by Business 
Insider as the 24th most valuable private tech company in the U.S.12 (Exhibit 3) Even so, it was 
facing increased competition in the AR space from many of the tech giants, such as Microsoft, 
Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and even Alphabet—which still maintained an equity interest in 
Niantic—and in the mobile game space from the major game publishers including Zynga, 
Tencent, and Activision Blizzard. Nevertheless, new opportunities were on the immediate horizon 
with the advent of 5G wireless technology, which will allow smart phone users to download data 
32 times faster than 4G and 729 faster than 3G.13 
 
To respond, Niantic had decided to turn its unique in-house AR mapping capability into a 
commercial product, branding it the Niantic Lab’s Real World Platform. To further its 
monetization effort, Niantic had announced in June 2018 that it would open this Real World 
Platform to other AR app developers, but now needed to determine which developers to work

with, and how many to work with overall.14 Looking further ahead to the anticipated 
advancements after 5G technology, Niantic needed to consider how the AR world might evolve 
beyond games and phones in the next decade—with new opportunities such as training, retail 
showcasing, and other commercial applications15 along with new hardware devices such as 
glasses and other wearables. What might Niantic’s role be then? 
 
As the “J-Staff” meeting was about to convene—the weekly gathering of Hanke and his direct 
reports—the executive team wondered how they should best prioritize where Niantic needed to 
place its bets now in order to scale-up and take advantage of the opportunities ahead. 
 
Background of John Hanke 
 
Hanke’s journey through his professional career is a great example of the Silicon Valley 
professional entrepreneur who recognizes trends, pursues these opportunities relentlessly, and 
then monetizes them. His story also demonstrates the dynamic interaction of the key components 
of Silicon Valley’s high-tech ecosystem. 
 
Texas Roots. Born and raised in Cross Plains, Texas—a tiny whistle stop-town of nearly 300 
families16 that was best known among pulp fiction devotees as being the birthplace of Robert E. 
Howard, the creator of the “Conan the Barbarian” character—and the son of the local postmaster, 
Hanke was a self-taught programmer who had first learned how to code when he was a young 
teen in junior high school.17 As an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin 
during the late 1980s, Hanke developed a keen interest in global affairs and he chaired the 
Distinguished Speakers Series that brought a number of accomplished individuals to lecture on 
campus, including former U.N. ambassador Jeanne Kilpatrick, novelist Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., and 
New York Times photographer Dith Pran.18 After graduating from UT with honors in 1989, 
Hanke pursued his interest in global affairs with the U.S. State Department’s Foreign Service, 
with assignments in both Washington D.C. and Myanmar.19 
 
The Berkeley Connection. After spending five years with the State Department and deciding 
against becoming a career diplomat, Hanke chose to return to his original interest in computer 
technology and headed west to UC Berkeley, where he joined the MBA program in the fall of 
1994. Hanke recalled: 
 
“It was a career transition for me. I grew up in the dawn of the personal computer 
era and was very passionate about programming back in the early days of the 
Apple and Atari. But it didn't really seem like a legitimate career [then]. [After 
working in the State Department,] I wanted to try to get back to technology. I 
figured that [if I was] moving to the West Coast, an MBA was a way to get 
established out there. I didn’t know anything about business, having worked in

the government. So I figured that I needed to learn a bit about accounting, 
finance, marketing, and other subjects. To me, it was establishing your network 
on the West Coast and [then] learning some basic skills for what you want to do.” 
 
Early Entrepreneurial Successes. As a full-time MBA student at Berkeley, Hanke took aim at 
creating his first startup in 1994 in the student incubator lab provided by the business school’s 
Lester Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, where Professor John Freeman served as its academic 
director and Professor Jerome Engel as its executive director. Together with Steve Sellers, a 
fellow MBA classmate, they founded a gaming company called Archetype Interactive in the 
basement of a local hotel—space funded by the Center. Hanke noted: 
 
“I loved programming games and thought that type of entertainment was 
interesting. I had an aspiration for starting a company based around gaming when 
I came out to the business school.” 
 
In starting up Archetype Interactive, Hanke demonstrated that he was not content with 
just being in the classroom and hearing professors and guest speakers lecture about what 
it took to start a company—he wanted to do it. With additional pro bono help from a 
Silicon Valley law firm in incorporating the company and raising a few hundred thousand 
dollars from family and friends, Sellers and Hanke then put together a small team, which 
eventually grew to 20 employees, to create a product. Hanke recalled: 
 
“We figured it out as we went. We knew that we needed to have more people to 
work on the application. We figured out how to raise some money, so we could 
hire some contractors…We went out on the Web—a common thing now, but a 
novelty back then [in 1994]—and found engineers, game designers, and artists. 
At the same time [at Berkeley-Haas] we learned how to set up a company, how to 
take in the money, and how to split everything up. We immediately put [those 
concepts] into practice.”20 
 
Archetype’s first and only product was Meridan 59, now credited as being the first 3-D graphical 
massively multi-user online role-playing game (MMORPG or MMOG). This was a direct 
extension of the innovations being championed by Netscape co-founder Jim Clark at the time, 
converging the opportunities provided from the soaring popularity of the Internet with the 
emergence of browser usage that allowed consumers to easily surf the Web.21 Hanke added: 
 
“There was only one trend when we were going through business school and that 
was the Internet. Netscape was in the process of coming into existence with its 
Mosaic browser when we were at Berkeley. It was still the dial-up modem days 
and the earliest days of the Internet. We were all trying to figure out how it 
would be relevant to the things we were interested in. Several companies got 
started by classmates during the time when we were at school. Steve and I started 
[Archetype]. We sold it on the day that we graduated [in May 1996].” 
 
After selling Archetype Interactive to Trip Hawkins and 3DO, a then-leader in the gaming 
industry, for a “few million dollars,” Hanke and Sellers stayed at 3DO for nearly a year before

starting up another gaming platform called The Big Network, which focused on casual games like 
chess and checkers.22 A year later in 1999, they sold The Big Network for several million dollars. 
 
Keyhole23 (1999-2004) 
 
Early Beginnings. With two solid “modest” successes under his belt and strong expertise in 3-D 
visualization, Hanke had credentials that passed for a seasoned Internet startup CEO in the preInternet bubble days of the late 1990s. The next challenge was not far away. A few months after 
selling The Big Network, he was already in search of his next entrepreneurial quest. Hanke was 
introduced to a talented technical team that had left Silicon Graphics to build at a new computer 
game startup and was shown an early demo that showcased a software technique to display and 
animate extremely high-resolution images with amazing graphics on a normal PC. The demo 
gave the feeling of being in space, seeing a globe textured with images and with the ability to 
zoom in and out of cities. 
 
The company, Intrinsic Graphics, and its investors were committed to being a game company, 
and Hanke saw something about the opportunity to create a “space platform” for earth images. 
The investors were not interested, considering it a “distraction.” Hanke remembered that when he 
first saw it, he felt “a chill up my spine.” At the time, space imagery was at a major technical 
inflection point as improved and higher resolution images were just becoming commercially 
available. Based on his previous experience in foreign affairs, Hanke foresaw the power of 
layering data on maps, using satellite imagery, and creating an entirely new type of geo-mapping 
experience (Exhibit 4a). As geographic information systems (GIS) evolved from basic computer 
mapping in the 1970s, then to the use of spatial database management in the 1990s, and finally to 
multimedia mapping in the 2000s (Exhibit 4b),24 Hanke anticipated that this data and user 
expertise would be valuable to high-value niche markets like real estate developers and 
eventually to the mass-market audience as well. Unable to convince Intrinsic Graphics investors 
to endorse his vision, he struck a deal to spinout the technology that supported the demo, 
recruited several of its key engineers and formed a new startup called Keyhole, with Hanke 
becoming its CEO. The mapping technology that be created at Keyhole would eventually serve 
as the basis for Hanke’s two other subsequent ventures—the Google Geo Division and Niantic 
Labs. 
 
Initial Financing. In January 2000, nearing the peak of venture capital investment “bubble” in 
the Internet, the company received its first round of financing led by the corporate venture group 
at Sony. The Keyhole vision and opportunity were compelling: a talented technical team, an 
“experienced” CEO, and the ability to configure and portray satellite imagery that previously had 
only been available in high-cost military and national defense applications. The main product 
EarthViewer3D transformed satellite images and aerial photography into a videogame-like 
experience. Later, they created a platform to add location-specific data, mapping boundaries, 
yellow page listings and address information. “Our goal is simple: to put the entire world in the 
hands of our customers,” said Hanke in a 2001 press release. 
 
But no matter how attractive the opportunity, the macro venture capital environment soon 
radically changed, leading to difficult times. Shortly after the initial funding, the investment

bubble burst and the venture capital community was in triage mode. Due to Keyhole’s dwindling 
working capital and large operating budget, Hanke faced some hard decisions. Progress slowed, 
spending was cut back, and simple survival became the top priority. Hanke recalled: 
 
“Our business model [at Keyhole in 2000] was about 15 years ahead of its time—
it was software as a service [SaaS]. We were one of the first people doing this. 
We created this massive database of Earth information, imagery map overlays, 
and lots of different data sets. We sold access to [Keyhole] on the monthly basis. 
Although we had originally started the company with the idea of that being a 
consumer company, where consumers would pay a [small fee] for the right to use 
it, the dot-com crash happened shortly after. We then pivoted to a B2B focus, 
selling [subscriptions] to engineering firms and real estate and land development 
companies, charging them hundreds to thousands of dollars per month to access 
the system.” 
 
Regaining Momentum. Finally, in 2003, things began to turn their way. “It wasn’t long after the 
bombs began erupting in Iraq [with the Second Gulf War] that all heck broke loose at a two-yearold Silicon Valley startup called Keyhole,” wrote the San Jose Mercury News in 2003. NVIDIA, 
an early marketing partner, and In-Q-Tel, a relatively new funding source connected to the CIA, 
bridged the company’s financing while it regained momentum. After the Iraqi invasion, a host of 
news organizations reported on Keyhole’s new found popularity and exposure, a result of their 
mapping software being used to illuminate news forecasts on CNN, ABC, CBS, and various 
foreign news outlets. Gilman Louie, the founder and then-CEO of In-Q-Tel, remembered looking 
up Keyhole because of his Bay Area connections. Louie recalled: 
 
“Keyhole wanted to map the world in 3D, but they couldn't really get anyone's 
attention without a real monetization model back then. However, John Gage, 
then the Chief Scientist at Sun Microsystems, suggested at a Christmas party in 
2002 that I take a look at them. The NGA (National Geospatial Intelligence 
Agency) and the CIA then had a need at the time to secure high-quality 
geospatial technology. I was blown away by what I first saw of Earthview 
3D. Unlike those of other geospatial companies, Keyhole took a gamers’ 
approach to mapping. John and his team made their maps look good for the 
average user and these maps could be also easily accessed online through a 
browser. While Sergey (Brin) and Larry (Page) had this vision to organize the 
world's information on Google, John had this vision to map the entire world on a 
laptop through Keyhole. In-Q-Tel then decided to invest in Keyhole almost 30 
days before the start of the Second Gulf War. It was interesting to see that the 
Earthview 3D maps being used by our intelligence analysts were the same ones 
appearing on the major television news networks in their reporting of the War, as 
the media companies had also licensed the Keyhole technology.” 
 
Acquisition by Google. With so much global exposure and the recovery of the venture capital 
climate, Keyhole was able to line up several interested investors in mid-summer 2004. Just as 
Hanke was closing the terms for a substantial Series B venture capital-led financing round, 
Google called. At the time, relatively little was known about Google; its initial public offering 
had not yet happened, and Google had been very secretive about its financial performance. 
Hanke was wary of Google, particularly because he was very close to committing to his next 
round of financing. However he did take the time to demonstrate the technology to a business 
development manager at Google, which was located only a few blocks from Keyhole’s Mountain 
View office.

Less than a day after the EarthViewer presentation, Google offered to buy Keyhole. Hanke was 
faced with a major decision. The founding team was reticent; they were attached to their vision 
for EarthViewer. Yet the opportunity to leverage Google’s vast and rapidly growing user base 
was appealing. Although the ultimate value of the acquisition was not fully apparent—Google 
was still pre-IPO and its success and the ultimate value of its stock was not assured. In the final 
analysis, the opportunity offered to see their vision come to maturity as part of Google was just 
too good to pass up. 
 
Google ‘Geo’ Products25 (2004-2010) 
 
The acquisition by Google proved a breakthrough. Hanke and all of his 30 Keyhole employees 
stayed on board after the “spin-in.” Able to leverage Google’s world-class engineering talent and 
financial resources, they made tremendous progress. When Google bought Keyhole, the highresolution imagery in EarthViewer was not available in some cities and other parts of the world, 
and the application was expensive. In 2002, the pricing of a Keyhole annual subscription was 
$1,200 per user. Once inside Google, Hanke and his team were no longer limited by the need to 
generate near-term cash flow. Google immediately lowered the price of the consumer version to 
under $30, and when Google Earth launched in June 2005 the software was made available for 
free. The acquisition was also a great strategic match for Google. The geo-products synched 
well with Google’s simple strategic vision: organizing the world’s information, improving search 
capabilities for that information, and making that information free. EarthViewer now rebranded 
as Google Earth, as fully manifested through Google’s platform, brought a whole new dimension 
of information to Google’s offering. Hanke noted: 
 
“Google's all about organizing the world’s information and making it useful. 
You can search text and you can do that great with the algorithms that Larry 
and Sergey originally created. That was the original core competency of the 
company. But [Larry and Sergey] were also looking at all the other domains of 
data, ways to organize that data, search for that data, and make that data useful 
to people. They had started maps, then searching for things on top of the map, 
and then all the data that is related to the earth and geography. [Geo] was a 
domain that they felt would be [ultimately] important to Google and they 
wanted to be good at it.26 So they bought us, and poured in a lot of capital.” 
 
The subsequent unleashing of even more vast amounts of free information, combined with the 
subsequent rise of the smart phone with its GPS capabilities and mobile location-based 
applications, was more than fortuitous. Application developers, large and small, were often 
driven by communities of users, all owed a great deal to the early Keyhole vision and the Google 
platform that helped build it on a global scale. 
 
Integration within Google. Google’s capacity to integrate the Keyhole team without destroying 
its ability to operate with entrepreneurial agility was vital. Shortly after the acquisition, there was 
a high-level discussion at Google on how the Keyhole team should be integrated into the 
company. The decision to keep Keyhole as an independent unit within Google proved critical.

advertisements.

Hanke recalled: 
 
“We had this initial meeting with the consulting types and other aspiring business 
leaders on how Keyhole should be folded in Google. Then, one of their most 
senior and most experienced executives, Wayne Rosen, the vice president of 
engineering, spoke up and said, ‘Leave these people alone. They know what 
they’re doing. They’re going to do great stuff. We brought them to do great 
stuff. Let them do that.’”27 
 
Scaling Up Quickly. The old Keyhole and the new “Keyhole-within-Google” operated at 
different orders of magnitude. For example, early in his career at Google, Hanke talked to Brin 
about a licensing deal to obtain more satellite imagery, expecting to buy a small portion of what 
was available. Brin authorized purchasing everything the vendor could possibly offer. The 
acquisition by Google was truly a transformative experience for Hanke and the Keyhole team. 
Before Google, being an entrepreneur at Keyhole meant creating a product at a managed scale 
and pursuing opportunities in relatively small increments. Now Hanke went from thinking about 
city-by-city rollout to thinking about the whole world. In many ways, Google Earth remained true 
to the Keyhole vision, but what it achieved was on a much grander scale and ultimately integrated 
with many other products and features such as Google Maps, Local, and Street View. Hanke 
learned to appreciate the luxury of operating at “Google Scale.” He recollected: 
 
“Things went beyond my wildest expectations of what our technology could 
become. To fully exploit it, we needed the full resources of Google. We needed 
the server infrastructure, we needed the additional engineers, and we needed their 
resources to fill our product imagery. When we wanted to partner with Digital 
Globe [the satellite image vendor] to get the highest possible resolution, Sergey 
said “get every useable pixel.”28 
 
Lean Innovation. While overseeing Google Geo, Hanke and his team often prototyped, 
improvised, and tested quickly. After years of looking at overhead images of specific locations, 
the idea for Street View emerged when Brin asked why the Google “couldn’t also capture 
imagery the way people saw it—from the ground.”29 The Geo-team then went out, hired 
contractors, and placed GPS cameras on top of cars, with the mandate to take images of every 
street angle possible. Anthony Levandowski, one of the Google software engineers on the Geo 
team, noted that following the principles of “having a ‘laser focus,’ pursuing ‘rapid turnarounds,’ 
and maintaining a ‘just do it’ attitude” were keys to creating innovative products.30 Levandowski 
recalled that the team initially didn’t have the resources to make things happen quickly in order to 
scale up Street View, so they improvised: 
 
“[We only had this one car that we were driving manually with a GPS camera to 
take the images]. We came to the realization that this one car wasn’t going fast 
enough and we needed to duplicate it…We were short of money and decided that

rental cars were cheap—you can rent them by the month for couple hundred of 
bucks—[so we used rental cars instead. We then built wooden racks to place the 
cameras on top] and then hired people off Craigslist, saying that we needed 
“professional tourists.” We would pay them each $10 per hour to “tour” and we 
then pushed this idea forward. [With the GPS cameras on top of the cars, we 
began to take images that we needed. The car rental agencies also got back cars 
with bald tires and a few dents], but you got to take risks to get the job done.”31 
 
Crowd-Sourced Open Innovation. Another key to the Geo’s ability to scale up new products 
quickly was that Google followed a “crowd-sourced open innovation” concept where the public 
could help make enhancements to all of their online offerings. For example, when Google was 
expanding internationally, it relied on its users to translate its pages into the local languages, 
without having to hire professional interpreters.32 Later, Google would open its Android 
operating system on smart phones to outside developers. Similarly, at Geo, a tool called “Map 
Maker” was created, as Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg wrote in “How Google Works”: 
 
“When our Geo team set out to chart the world’s geography, they discovered that 
for a good many areas good maps simply didn’t exist. They created Map Maker, 
which lets anyone contribute to Google Maps. Live on a street that doesn’t show 
up on the Map? No problem: Just draw a line in and we’ll add it in (after we 
make sure that it’s actually there). Thus was built a new community of grassroots citizen cartographers, who made it so that the maps of entire cites were just 
a mouse-click way for our users. For example, they mapped over twenty-five 
thousand kilometers of roads in Pakistan in just two months.”33 
 
Today, Google’s maps products form a platform that more than one million sites and app 
developers have used to build businesses, serving more than one billion users each week.34 These 
GPS-based businesses include Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Yelp, Waze, and Open Table. Hanke 
observed: 
 
“A lot goes back to Google and its founders’ decision to really invest in a large 
amount of geographic data and putting it on the Web very freely. [The founders 
had also decided to make] Google Maps APIs35 [openly available] where 
anybody can go out and build a company and a product on top of the data. Most 
other companies would have bundled and charged for this. By enriching the 
Web, Google believed that [the company] would benefit in some broad way.”36 
 
On his experience in building the Geo division, Hanke reflected: 
 
“[Google Geo] was like a post-doc business education—scaling up with 
everything was growing like crazy within Google at that time. Teams

were growing, our business was growing, we wanted to do things quickly, 
so it was a tremendous amount of fun. It was very, very rewarding.” 
 
Niantic Labs 1.0 (2010-2015) 
 
Building Niantic Labs within Google37 After overseeing the Google Geo Division—now 
numbering nearly 2,000 “Googlers”—Hanke rekindled his entrepreneurial and gaming interests 
in 2010, by starting up a “skunkworks”-type project within Google called Niantic Labs—named 
after a whaling ship that was grounded and abandoned in San Francisco when its crew joined the 
1849 Gold Rush.38 Hanke explained the rationale for taking on Niantic Labs, whose mandate for 
its 30-some employees was to find new opportunities for Google where mobile, geo-based maps, 
social, and gaming trends converged: 
 
“I had been leading the geo content part of Google for about six years and I 
eventually became interested in what we could do with our investment in 
mapping technology in the mobile space. Anything that we were doing with 
Niantic [was] based around location services and mobile phones.” 
 
He also added: 
 
“I [also] wanted to be more directly involved in product development and the 
creation process [again]. When organizational size and layers of management 
come into play, it’s harder to directly influence what you’re working on. So I 
talked with my colleagues at Google and they said, ‘We’d like to find a way for 
you to do this inside of Google.’”39 
 
For Hanke, Niantic also tied together mapping and gaming, his two most important work 
passions. He noted: 
 
“I had taken a hiatus from games for a long time, but the latest stuff that I’ve 
been working on the past [few] years [at Niantic] took the work that Google’s 
been doing in mapping and combined it with games.” 
 
Field Trip. At Niantic Labs, two location-based app products were created. The first was Field 
Trip. Launched in early 2012, it was built around an early version of Google Glass. Hanke 
noted: 
 
“We launched a product called Field Trip. It’s about information discovery. We 
ultimately incorporated over 300 publishing partners into that, and [Field Trip] 
surfaces information about the world as you’re out moving around, [similar to] 
the story about the Niantic ship. [Field Trip] basically tells you about stuff that's 
around you. So it could be information about a bar, art, architecture, or 
shopping. [The publishing partners] that we signed on were to basically funnel 
content to that. We were trying to predict the future and were looking at [AR] 
trends with Google Glass. We all know how that [initial experiment with Google 
Glass] went. So, maybe that’s the trend lesson: you have a fundamental trend

that may be valid, but they’re going to be fits and starts along the way and maybe 
that was one of them.” 
 
Ingress. The second product was Ingress, a location-based MMOG that launched in late 2012. 
Ingress has been described by its players as being “a giant game of capture the flag, where you 
play a video game, but in real life” or “being like Four Square meets geo-caching meets a giant 
game of Risk, where the board is like the surface of the earth” and “you actually have to go out in 
the real world to play the game.”40 Under Ingress, players could choose to be “an agent” on one 
of two teams—The Resistance or The Enlightened—with the mission to seek out and virtually 
take over physical landmarks labeled as “Portals” for their teams by using a smart phone app. 
When eight team members designate their resonators onto a specific portal through their 
individual smart phones, they secure the portal for their team. Hanke explained the concept. 
 
“We basically took the concept of an MMO-type game where you have millions 
of people all collectively participating in a massive game that goes on forever. 
We took it out from the computer, and basically just broke it out into the real 
world [with a mobile device]. It’s very similar to the MMO stuff that we were 
doing way back [when Meridan 59 was launched].” 
 
Design Rules. In designing Ingress, the Niantic team followed four basic design rules: 1) The 
World is the Map; 2) Move to Play; 3) Urban Exploration; and 4) Social.41 
 
By making “The World is the Map,” the Niantic team did not want to limit the games’ scope to a 
select few geographic locations. They wanted to have players from all around the world in order 
to scale up the game’s popularity. By requiring participants “Move to Play,” Hanke—an outdoor 
enthusiast himself—and his team wanted typical video gamers to get away from being in front of 
a screen and seek some exercise while playing. By creating an “Urban Exploration” aspect to the 
game, the Niantic team wanted participants to have a learning aspect by playing. And by 
“Social,” the MMO aspects of the game allowed players to meet others in the real world. 
 
Synergies with Google. Individual Ingress players could also create individual Google+ pages to 
share with other participants and a weekly Ingress Report on YouTube provided all players on 
Ingress activities worldwide. As of February 2014, there were 1.78 million Ingress players who 
had created Google+ pages and there were 5,000 local Google+ communities centered on 
Ingress.42 As Hanke noted at a video gaming conference about Ingress’s tie-in with Google’s 
products: 
 
“The next step is to take this concept of Google as an entertainment platform and 
help people more fully utilize it. What we did with Ingress, using Google+ as a 
storytelling mechanism, YouTube as a mechanism to provide video content about 
the environment, and Google Play as a way to get books and comic books out 
there. [This platform was then used] in conjunction with gamers to really create 
an environment where people can really live in not just for a few hours when 
they play the game but to engage the community over days, weeks, and years.”43

Although fairly independent inside of Google, Niantic had access to all of the company’s 
resources. Hanke commented: 
 
“Niantic is able to move pretty autonomously and quickly, but we’re still able to 
tap into other groups at the company and build on the relationships and data and 
infrastructure that we have at Google.”44 
 
Being part of Google also allowed Niantic to uniquely test their games among a global group of 
highly talented employees. Hanke explained: 
 
“We leveraged the fact that [Niantic was] within Google. We had this long 
internal beta test with Google’s then—40,000 employees around the world to 
whom we were iteratively releasing versions of the software. It’s a game that 
geeks really like…There were people in Zürich and Tokyo and Berlin and Cape 
Town who are Google employees that sort of helped spread the word. We also 
relied heavily on public relations. [Ingress is] a truly novel thing. [Ingress] 
wasn't an imitation of anything else, so that's always an advantage to go out and 
talk to the press about something that's really new.” 
 
Niantic Labs 2.0 (2015-16) 
 
After being part of the Google for five years, Niantic was spun-out in November 2015—after 
months of internal negotiations— just two months after Google announced a reorganization of 
the company that established Alphabet as its newly-named parent company (Exhibit 5). While 
there were several advantages to staying within Google, Hanke believed that over the long-term, 
strategic considerations outweighed them. Hanke said: 
 
“Being inside of Google we have infrastructure: offices around the world; great 
talents from which we could assemble the team very easily; and real estate, IT, 
legal, and accounting support—all those functions were available to us. We 
didn’t have to go out and try to create those ourselves. We could focus on just 
the product. Obviously being part of a parent company like Google has a 
tremendous advantage when you're trying to introduce a new product… 
 
[On the other hand], we found over time that our interests and our focus were 
diverging from the interests of the core part of [Google], so the synergies weren’t 
as great as maybe we initially anticipated, and it added to the luster of doing this 
spin out.” 
 
Building Internal Infrastructure. Leaving Google meant that many of the support functions—
finance, legal, purchasing, people management, and facilities—that Niantic had automatically 
received as an internal unit were no longer available Hence, Hanke had to recruit department 
heads to build out these areas. In addition, Niantic also now had to pay Google commissions on 
downloads of its games made through the Google Play store and a licensing fee for using Google 
maps. Carl Damerow (MBA ’15), Niantic’s business development manager, who left Google to 
stay with Niantic, recalled the “growing pains” of building a standalone company during the first 
few months:

“Those first nine months, post spin-out but pre-Pokémon Go, we essentially had 
two business people…paying utility bills, negotiating leases, all the back-office 
stuff. I was writing contracts, handling accounts payable and receivable… it’s a 
bit of like getting cold water over the head because all the trappings and 
infrastructure of Google which was so nice was kind of ripped out from under and 
it’s like, ‘Oh we have to pay the utility bills, and we have to sign up every vendor, 
and we have to do all the back office stuff.’” 
 
Among key hires to build out this “back office” scaling capability were VP Finance Jeff Shouger 
and VP People David Hanrahan. Sustained value creation and rapid growth would require resource 
acquisition and management [capital and talent], not only customers and revenue. 
 
Pokémon Go. In the midst of the 2015 spin-out discussions, the 41-member Niantic team had 
remained hard at work since the prior summer on developing “Pokémon Go”—the first-ever 
augmented-reality (AR) game for the Pokémon Company and Nintendo—for a 2016 release. 
With this MMO-based45 game, participants could virtually find, capture, trade, or battle any one 
of Pokémon’s 800+ characters—Pikachu, Jigglypuff, and Charizard among them—at various 
geographic locations around the globe by using a smart phone. (Exhibit 2). An optional 
bracelet—Pokémon Go Plus—would alert players when there were Pokémon characters nearby 
so that they could find and catch them without having to look at the phone screen.46 The more 
characters that a Pokémon Go player acquired, the more points he or she would accumulate, a 
digital extension of the madly popular Pokémon trading cards. In building Pokémon Go, Niantic 
would apply the same four design elements that they had applied to Ingress: The World is the 
Game; Move to Play; Urban Exploration; and Social. Reflecting on Niantic’s keiretsu47-like 
relationship with the two Japanese companies, Hanke noted: 
“[The spin-out from Google allowed] us to do something like this with Nintendo 
and Pokémon. They can invest and be a co-owner of the company and feel like 
they have a very tight relationship. [The Pokémon Company and Nintendo are] 
putting the number two video game franchise of all time48 in the hands of this 
project. It would be more difficult to do if they didn’t at least own a portion of 
the company. They feel like there’s a good alignment of interest.”49 
Both Japanese companies have been two of most dominant global players in the modern gaming 
history. Launched in 1995, the Pokémon franchise has since become a worldwide phenomenon 
as millions of fans sought to collect, train, and trade the Pokémon characters—each brought to 
life with their own light-hearted backstory—across multiple media platforms: video games, 
handheld consoles, and trading cards.50 Nintendo has been the long-time manufacturer of video 
game consoles—Game Boy, Nintendo DS, and the Wii—and had partnered with the Pokémon 
franchise since its inception. With both companies providing financing and having an equity 
stake in Niantic—and Niantic not having to focus on VC funding—Hanke hoped to tap into the 
deep gaming capabilities possessed by each company. Hanke noted: 

45 The acronym MMO stands for “massively multi-player online.” 
46 http://www.pokemongo.com/en-us/pokemon-go-plus/ 
47 Keirestsu is the Japanese term for a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings that 
often act as an informal business group. Keiretsu-type companies emerged during he 19h century and remain 
dominant in Japan’s present day economy. 
48 Nintendo’s “Mario”, launched in 1983, is the all-time best selling game of all-time.

“[The interest in Niantic] was driven in large part by Mr. [Tsunekazu] Ishihara 
and the Pokémon Company. They’ve been involved in developing all the 
Pokémon games through the years. They guide the IP [intellectual property]. 
But a lot of what they do is through partnerships. They partnered initially with 
Wizards of the Coast to bring out the Pokémon card game, which has now sold 
something like 21 billion cards. They have animation partners who do the TV 
show. They’re a partnering type of company. Mr. Ishihara [who was also a huge 
fan of the Ingress game] ushered us into the halls at Nintendo.”51 
Through this partnership with Pokémon’s fan base of millions, Niantic also hoped that it would 
be able to raise the brand awareness for its portfolio of future AR games.52 Hanke continued: 
“[In working with companies like Pokémon], part of what we’re trying to do is 
show people that breadth of game play styles and genres you can fit into this realworld gaming category… Ingress is one data point. Pokémon is a data point. 
There will be some other interesting ones as well. It’s been fun to watch the 
phone ring after the Pokémon announcement.”53
 
Added Damerow: 
“We really didn’t exist to the world until after Pokémon Go and we were the smash 
hit—the overnight smash hit that was five years in the making, just nobody knew 
about it.” 
 
Scaling Up Niantic, Learning from Google 
 
Despite being spun out of Google and having to bear its own infrastructure costs, Niantic still 
retained many of the Google’s best practices in its organizational DNA that would enable it to 
scale up effectively, especially in the areas of product management, efficiency in scaling, 
engineering collaboration, and building a mission-driven culture. Many on Niantic’s executive 
team, such as Phil Keslin, Chief Technology Officer; Kei Kawai, Vice President of Product 
Management; Ed Wu (MBA ’18), Vice President of Platform; Mike Quigley (MBA ’96), Vice 
President of Marketing; and Daniel Lederman, Vice President of Business Development, were 
past Googlers who had decided to remain with a standalone Niantic. 
 
Product Management Focus. At Google, product managers were typically responsible for 
championing the user’s experience with a product, managing a product’s lifecycle54 and acquiring 
the necessary cross-departmental resources needed to successfully navigate a product internally. 
In short, product managers were responsible for the product’s vision (what should be built), 
design (what should it reasonably look like); implementation (adjusting to reality and tradeoffs) 
and release (communicate efficiently to users).55 At Niantic this product management approach 
was the same. Kawai observed:

“At the end of the day, product management touches almost every aspect of the 
company…we are the hub of information [and] we are its central nervous 
system…We are committed to preserving the culture of moving fast, focusing on 
innovation and engineering design, and building accountability across all 
functions to achieve business results in a certain way.….So, that’s what we took 
from Google. We still believe in innovation as a way to differentiate ourselves 
instead of copying that which is known and proven.” 
 
Scaling Up Strategically. Another key element inherited from Google was the strategic mindset 
of how to scale-up efficiently and effectively. Damerow explained: 
 
“I think one of the best practices we took from Google was thinking strategically 
about scale and making the choices on how to best scale-up efficiently over the 
long-run. For example, take headcount planning, where decisions on where to 
spend the money are really on the line. Should we hire another producer for one 
game or a platform product manager that will benefit 10 game kits? The choice is 
often the latter, despite some short-term pain. I think that’s a distinctive 
discipline, an approach to scale that probably came out of Google. It’s about 
where our needs are going to be in a year out from now as opposed to what we 
need right now.” 
 
Engineering Collaboration. Another best practice adopted from Google was the level of 
collaboration throughout Niantic’s engineering ranks. Wu observed: 
 
“We do design docs largely by consensus, as opposed to like some companies 
have architects that do all the designs top-down. Google doesn’t do that and 
neither do we. Everyone from the most senior engineers to junior engineers are 
expected to write design docs—starting the discussion and bringing it to a 
useful consensus before implementation. That’s a style of collaboration that we 
bought with us as an engineering practice from Google. Also, many of our 
technical managers can also write code in addition to managing people.” 
 
Building a Mission-Driven Culture. With the number of employees increasing ten-fold from 41 
at the time of its 2015 spinoff to 455 at year-end 2018, building a company around its core values 
is a priority for Niantic’s executive team. Other organizational elements that Niantic was able to 
bring from Google—such as the use of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to align the 
organization’s goal from top to bottom, and the weekly TGIF all-hands meeting to promote 
collaboration, communication and transparency—all help reinforce Niantic’s culture. Shouger, 
who had been previously Zynga’s controller through its IPO, observed: 
 
“We are focused on building our culture…Regular, bottoms-up employee 
surveys ‘take the temperature’ of the company….We’re a young company, and 
we’re soliciting feedback from people within the company on how we’re doing 
along many measures, including pursuit of certain Niantic values—e.g., creating 
products that encourage exploration, outdoor, and social experiences, and social 
responsibility—and how we execute with agility, accountability, trust and 
respect, so all individuals are empowered to strive and achieve shared goals.”

Scaling Up through Partnerships: Operations, Sponsorships and IP Licensing 
 
To scale-up quickly, Niantic leverages three types of partnerships: operational deals, 
sponsorships, and IP licensing. First there are the partnerships that are tech and operationally 
related, such as Unity and the Google Cloud platforms, which accelerated Niantic’s ability to 
make their games available to users. Then there are the sponsorships, such as making every 
Starbucks a Pokestop, enhancing users’ experience while generating revenue. And then there is IP 
licensing, such as Pokémon and Harry Potter, which is essential to a gaming company in 
leveraging branded content that already has a wide appeal. 
 
In order to pursue any of these options to scale-up, a central question for Niantic was what other 
types of strategic partnerships they should pursue. Should these future partnerships be structured 
as equity ownership, revenue sharing, or joint ventures? And, should Niantic, in seeking more 
cash to grow its business, pursue equity funding from venture capitalists? Also, how might 
having multiple geographic locations around the world help Niantic scale faster? By early 2019, 
Niantic had gone through three financing rounds: : a Series A round in October 2015 and 
February 2016 that raised a combined $25 million; a Series B round in November 2017 of $200 
million; and a Series C round in December 2018 of $245 million56. 
 
Scaling Up, 5G and Building the Real World Platform 
 
The Emergence of 5G. With the next generation of wireless technology upon us—a key 
inflection point for digital-and-mobile based entities— 5G “will supercharge cellphones, but its 
real strength lies in the potential to power ‘The Internet of Things,’ a byword for everything 
electronic other than the smartphone.”57 With an increased number of wireless equipment 
postings and faster data transfer times, network connectively will be enhanced with additional 
channels. Consider this: The popular game Fortnight on a smart phone would take 29 hours to 
download with 3G; 14 minutes, 4G; and only 24 seconds, 5G.58 Or this: an hour-long Spotify 
playlist would take 7 minutes with 3G; 20 seconds, 4G; and only 0.6 seconds, 5G.59 This new 
wireless technology will also improve and enhance the AR experience, compared to the existing 
3G or 4G networks. Hanke explained: 
 
“What’s it about 5G that’s relevant to AR gaming? …The reason being is that 
we’re really pushing the boundaries on what we can do now on today’s [4G] 
network. We need 5G to deliver the kind of experiences that we are imagining... 
three examples of that. 
 
The first example is the idea of the AR cloud…The AR cloud is a mapping. You 
can think of it as a continuation of the mapping of the earth that we did at 
Google. But this map is not built for people, it’s built for computers… for your 
phone… for AR glasses…For the computer to know where it is in the world, we 
have to photograph and analyze that environment and create an AR map on the

cloud and then serve it back to allow all of the users to play a game in that space. 
That allows all of the people to share the same virtual reality…But the starting 
point is that map…[which] requires a great network…another technology [5G 
leverages] …is the idea of “edge computing”—moving the storage closer to the 
user…you need a specific piece of information that can sit at a local cell site 
where you can access it very quickly…. 
 
The second [example]…in terms of 5G is these live events that we host … 
concerts in terms of hundreds or thousands of people aggregating together in a 
single spot, all using their phones to play an intensive mobile network 
game…We have pushed the current 4G network to its limits and sometimes 
beyond its limits. The [existing] networks were not met for this many people in a 
very tight geographically-compressed location to be doing network intensive 
things all at the same time… we need that next level of [5G] network 
[capability]… 
 
Finally, [the third example is] latency…latency is the time that it takes for you to 
request a piece of data and it coming back to you. To do good AR we need 
latency that is close to 10 milliseconds and that would contrast to the 100 
milliseconds that you would get today, even in a good network situation. Why 
does it matter for AR? …We’re all having a shared AR experience … If someone 
is moving quickly and the servers are not synchronized you can see that in a very 
obvious way.”60 
 
Niantic’s Real Network Platform. To take advantage of these real-time opportunities presented 
by the new 5G wireless technology for AR gaming, Niantic has developed a proprietary Real 
World Platform, (Exhibit 6) or an “operating system that bridges the digital and physical 
world.”61 The Real World Platform is described by Niantic as advancing “the way computers see 
the world, moving from a model centered around roads and cars to a world centered around 
people. Modeling this people-focused world of parks, trails, sidewalks, and other publicly 
accessible spaces requires significant computation. The technology must be able to resolve 
minute details, to specifically digitize these places, and to model them in an interactive 3D space 
that a computer can quickly and easily read.”62 Even though Niantic’s games will remain 
available to users through the Unity platform, its Real Network Platform will enhance the Niantic 
gaming experience with advanced AR and mapping. 
In June 2018, Niantic announced that third-party developers will be invited to make games on the 
Real Network Platform—an “open innovation” approach that Niantic had been experimenting 
with since 2015. This possibility would allow Niantic to expand its business on a much grander 
scale by opening up its propriety platform to third-party developers that would allow the company 
to offer a much wider portfolio of AR games, similar to the major movie studios who partner with 
smaller production companies to distribute the latter’s films. The question for Niantic was how 
many of these third-party games should be permitted to join the platform, what would the criteria

be, and how could they avoid the pitfalls of product proliferation? Damerow explained the range 
of Niantic’s strategic choices: 
“Are we just a publisher who makes one monster game every few years or are we 
a platform like Unity or like Unreal? Those are the two main game engines where 
there’s 10,000 games on a platform. Or, are we somewhere in between where we 
are sort of like a curator [in selecting which third party games appear on our 
platform]? We have the first big first party of in-house blockbuster titles but then 
portfolios of smaller first and second-and-third party titles?... But at the same time 
how many AR location-based games can the market bear? Do we want to flood the 
market with 100 games in a year? Probably not.” 
 
Wu added: 
 
“It doesn’t make sense for us to become a technology stack like Unity. We don’t 
want to commoditize our technology with tens of thousands of [games on it]. There 
are significant ‘n- squared’ effects to the games that we produce. We know that 
our games are apparently social. …Instead of taking 2% to 3% of revenue as a 
technology provider, [can we be taking] 30%, 50%, 70% cuts of gross revenue as 
a publisher?... [Are we] making the right batch to put the right titles up and utilizing 
our marketing scale and existing channels in our player base to actually propel up 
awesome game ideas into that top 50 range? And so, working with third parties 
doesn’t mean handing over technology to the third parties…it means having a more 
comprehensive relationship where we work with them to cultivate their ideas and 
bring them to market as a publisher.” 
 
The Business Model 
 
Niantic Labs is privately-held and does not report its financial results, but clearly it has been 
wildly successful. Some sources in the public domain have estimated that the company had made 
over $2 billion in top-line revenue since the launch of Pokémon Go63 and has been reportedly 
cash-flow positive since 2016.64 Niantic principally derives revenue from in-game purchases—
where users buy online items to enhance their online gaming experience—and sponsorships. 
Shouger explained: 
 
“The current business model is that we provide games or experiences, 
entertainment experiences on the cell phone. And, one of our products is one of 
the most popular games in the world—Pokémon Go. When players go into 
Pokémon Go, and after a time want to enhance their experience, they can pay for 
certain things. 
 
Perhaps they would like more pokeballs, egg incubators, item storage, or raid 
passes. They can purchase them; that is known as an in-app purchase. Basically, 
that’s how our model works. We’re providing an experience that committed

players want to enhance. These in-app purchases are processed for us by the big 
third parties, the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. Apple and Google 
take 30% fee, we keep the rest. And we share that money with our partners. And 
we pay for our operating expenses [from that]. 
 
In addition to in-app purchases, a secondary revenue stream is sponsorship. 
These fees are paid by sponsors to create real world engagement with their 
products and services. For example, if, while playing Pokémon Go, you go in 
front of Starbucks, and see a Starbucks Pokestop, you will get special Starbucks 
rewards special items. Sponsorships is a relatively small but growing portion of 
our revenue. It is a real opportunity for future revenue growth. 
 
As we execute, we are proving that we can create a substantial and evergreen 
revenue stream that is much longer-lived than most online gaming experiences. 
Today, it’s in-app purchases, and enhanced sponsorship revenue. 
 
Over the longer term, with the launch of our Niantic Real World Platform we 
will have new business lines including, but not limited to, third party game 
development. Enabling others to create compelling AR experiences and games, 
utilizing our platform, will create a win-win: expanding and accelerating the 
adoption of AR and creating a substantial new revue stream independent of the 
performance of our own tittles. 
 
When you look even further into the future, with the arrival of AR glasses, our 
platform will be a crucial element in providing critical cloud-based mapping on a 
human scale. We will provide the base layer for mobile AR capability. As form 
factors evolve, from the phone that everybody uses today to AR glasses and other 
devices in the future, our vision is to be an essential element in the AR ecosystem 
enabling superb platform agnostic AR experiences.” 
 
Competitors 
 
Key AR competitors to Niantic include many of the tech giants, including Microsoft, Facebook, 
Amazon, and Alphabet. Other competitors include established mobile game providers such as 
Zynga and Activision Blizzard, and also online gaming platforms, such as Unity and Epic Games. 
(Exhibit 7) Niantic believes it’s often competing against itself as AR’s “world order” is still being 
defined. Quigley, who was previously a group vice president of marketing at Electronic Arts, noted 
that the AR industry is not an established one, like consumer-packaged goods, where gaining 
marketing share is often becomes a “zero-sum” game: 
 
“We pride ourselves that we are doing something that hasn’t been done before… 
We’re a mission-driven company and focused on creating the user experience 
around the three pillars of exploration and discovery, physical movement and 
exercise, and real-world social experiences in the real world with other people… 
not to sound arrogant, we’re not really focused on competitors. We’re focused on 
what we do…we want to continue to innovate and to do these things to get people 
out in the real world.”

A Morgan Stanley analyst report on Niantic, published in May 2019, argued that the company’s 
Real World Platform might be ultimate key to its future success, by building a broader and more 
diverse platform with third party developers that some believe will eventually go beyond just AR 
games. 
 
“Niantic competes with the game publishers in our coverage, particularly those 
with greater exposure to mobile, such as [Zynga] and [Activision Blizzard]. That 
said, the continued success of Pokémon Go and lack of strong competitors in the 
AR game segment speak to Niantic’s unique footprint and capabilities. 
Ultimately, Niantic's efforts around Real World Platform speak to its ambitions 
to leverage a unique and successful game property into a platform, similar to the 
symbiotic relationship Epic Games has created between the Unreal Engine and 
its games like Fortnite. Niantic’s success or failure in this could serve as 
important bellwether for game makers’ ability to leverage key properties into 
broader opportunities. In our view, this is an important question in a world where 
platforms like Xbox/Valve/Stadia and tools like Unity/Unreal may only become 
more important going forward.”65 
 
Looking Ahead 
 
Hanke believed the gaming industry was at the brink of a strategic inflection point, with the 
emergence of both AR and VR. He noted: 
 
“We’re at the beginning of something quite important. The future is one where 
the world and perhaps all of the experiences in the physical world are going to be 
augmented with digital interaction, interfaces, information and, yes, of course, 
entertainment. I think it’s going to be a pretty big deal. Yes, it’s been hyped, but 
this is one of those paradigm changes that happens maybe once a decade—maybe 
once every couple of decades. I lived through the rise of the microcomputer in 
my youth. I was at Google and saw the rise of the cloud and we participated in 
the rise of mobile through Android and iPhone and I think the transition to AR 
and this ubiquitous computing is that kind of a transition. So we at Niantic are 
very excited to be building the very first pieces of that transition today.”66 
 
Despite the trend lines supporting AR, there are still there some inherent risks. Ross Finman, the 
co-founder of Escher Reality whose company was purchased by Niantic in 2018 and now serves 
as a strategic AR advisor to the company’s executive team believed that timing is key: 
 
“The main thing for me is, one, the question of timing of the market. If the AR 
market takes 15 years to develop, Niantic will be too early. If the AR market 
takes off in two months, then we're too late. I don't think it’s either of those 
extremes, but is it three years out, eight years out, or ten years out, where exactly 
are the critical inflection points that will create the opportunity for massive 
impact and commercial success?”

Case Discussion Questions 
 
1. What should Niantic do to scale its growth and create value? 
 
2. In pursuing any of these options to scale-up, what other types of strategic partnerships should 
Niantic pursue? Should these future partnerships be structured as equity ownership, revenue 
sharing, or joint ventures? And, should Niantic, in seeking more cash to grow its business seek 
funding from venture capitalists? Also, how might having multiple geographic locations 
around the world help Niantic scale faster? 
 
3. How can Niantic capture value from evolving innovation trends, especially with the advent of 
5G, Internet-of-Things, and the distribution of augmented reality beyond gaming? 
 
4. In opening its proprietary Real World Platform to third party developers, what criteria 
should Niantic use to choose among them? 
 
5. Think your way through the requirements and opportunities of Niantic’s various future 
strategies. The Business Model Canvas can be a good tool for this. From the alternative 
strategies you have identified above, select two and then develop and compare the 
business models—identifying the critical requirements and opportunities of each. They 
are likely to be quite different [e.g. B2B vs B2C]. How does that influence your strategy 
recommendation? What would you emphasize in the pursuit of scale, and near and 
long-term value creation? 
 
Elements you consider would include: 
 
• 
Customer Segments 
• 
Value Propositions 
• 
Channels 
• 
Customer Relationships 
• 
Product Market Fit 
• 
Revenue Streams

Appendix 
 
The Geography of Innovation and its Impact on Entrepreneurial Strategy 
Cluster of Innovation: Silicon Valley67 
 
As an entrepreneur, Hanke’s career benefitted from the Silicon Valley’s ecosystem as he 
intersected with different key components at different points in his career. A description of the 
Silicon Valley’s ecosystem as seen through a “Cluster of Innovation” (COI) lens follows. 
 
A global “hot spot.” COIs are global economic “hot spots” where new technologies germinate at 
an astounding rate and where pools of capital, expertise, and talent foster the new ways of doing 
business. They are vibrant, effervescent, ecosystems composed of startups, businesses that 
support the startup process, and mature enterprises (many of whom evolved from rapidly from a 
startup history). In these ecosystems, resources of people, capital, and know-how are fluidly 
mobile and the pace of transactions is driven by a relentless pursuit of opportunity, staged 
financing, and short business model cycles. 
 
In California’s Silicon Valley, the archetype of such a cluster, several key components define 
these aggregations: universities, government, entrepreneurs, venture capital investors, mature 
corporations, R&D centers, and specialized service providers and management.68 (Exhibit A) 
They are also distinguished by key behaviors that favor the development of high-potential 
entrepreneurial ventures: a high mobility of resources (principally people, capital, and 
information—including intellectual property); an entrepreneurial process (the relentless pursuit of 
opportunity without regard for resource limitations); increased velocity of business development; 
a strategic global perspective; a culture of alignment of interests and transaction structures that 
reinforced that alignment; incentives and goals that lead to an affinity for collaboration; and 
development of global ties and bonds. 
 
Silicon Valley is an example of a COI, but certainly not the only COI. Many exist around the 
world. Many communities share some of the COI attributes and gain advantage by forming close 
linkages to other innovation hot-spots. Let’s take a closer look at Silicon Valley and reflect on 
how these attributes are also reflected in other communities we are familiar with around the 
world. 
 
Key COI Components 
 
Three components—universities, government, and entrepreneurs—played key historic roles in the 
transformation of the Silicon Valley from a small agricultural valley into the global powerhouse 
of invention and business creation that now extends north into San Francisco and the East Bay 
corridor. 
 
Universities. Major universities, such as the University of California at Berkeley, the University 
of California at San Francisco, and Stanford University, were the sources of new technologies and 
inventions. Universities supported commercialization of technology with entrepreneurship 
education, incubators, and seed funding. For example, at Berkeley, between 1988 and 2012, there

Process,” Business Horizons, 52/5 (September 2009): 493-503.

were 140 startups from university inventions, including 65 funded at an average of $13.8 million 
dollars each. At Stanford, between 2006 and 2012, there were 8,961 patents and 2,770 spin-off 
companies. In addition, there were 30 other colleges and universities in the San Francisco Bay 
Area that provided an ongoing pool of talent. 
 
Government. Immediately before World War II and during the Cold War decades afterwards, 
military contracts provided contracts at Stanford that led to the growth of pillar Silicon Valley 
companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Varian, and Lockheed Missiles and Space. This provided 
the foundation for a future techno-centric innovation cluster. In addition, ongoing federally 
funded research labs, such as the Berkeley National Laboratory, played a central role in ongoing 
interdisciplinary research. Finally, government policies, such as the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, 
gave invention ownership to universities instead of government, fostering spin-offs from 
government-sponsored research. 
 
Entrepreneurs. The work force is not only highly educated and technically skilled, but extremely 
innovative and entrepreneurial. For example, in 2010, the ZIP code 95054—the suburban city of 
Santa Clara in the heart of the Silicon Valley—produced the most industrial patents of any zip 
code in the U.S. With over 20,000 patents, this zip code would be ranked 17th compared to all the 
nations globally. Startups, and the entrepreneurs that drive them, are often highlighted in popular 
culture. Apple (Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak), Google (Page and Brin), and Facebook (Mark 
Zuckerburg) have become cultural icons. This entrepreneurial spirit evolved from California’s 
Gold Rush Days, when adventurous individuals turned their attention to other enterprises in the 
Bay Area. What differentiated these adventurous individuals was their willingness to take big 
risk in return for big gains. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs seek potential upsides and are willing to 
use outside equity financing in pursuit of these gains, even though it may come at the high price 
of diluted control over their ventures. 
 
Other Significant COI Components 
 
In addition, four other significant COI components—venture capital, mature corporations, 
industrial research centers, and service providers and management—evolved in the Silicon Valley 
as it developed.69 
 
Venture Capital. Investments in the early Silicon Valley startups, such as Shockley 
Semiconductor Labs and Fairchild Semiconductor, were provided by operating corporations, not 
investment firms. With the first IPOs of the Silicon Valley startups—Varian in 1956, HewlettPackard in 1957, and Ampex in 1958—professional venture capital firms appeared, investing 
their own capital in early-stage companies as well as funds from large institutional investors, such 
as pension funds. Venture capital investors have provided critical capital to nascent companies—
in the last decade VC investment in the U.S. has been $26 billion to $30 billion with one-third 
invested regularly invested in Silicon Valley. In 2012, the San Francisco Bay Area, including the 
Silicon Valley, accounted for 40 percent of all the venture capital spending in the top 100 U.S. 
cities. (Exhibit B) 
 
Mature Corporations. Many of Silicon Valley’s best-known global enterprises (such as Intel, 
Apple, Cisco, Google, and Genentech) are recently birthed entrepreneurial firms that recognized 
the benefits of collaborating with emerging firms. Collaboration between mature corporations

and startups can take many forms, from simple contractual agreements to equity investments, 
partnerships, and acquisitions. 
 
Industrial Research Centers. As Silicon Valley expanded, so did the bounty of research centers. 
In addition to federally funded research labs, many major corporations also created research and 
development (R&D) centers either because they were headquartered in the Valley (like HewlettPackard or Cisco) or because they wanted their researchers closer to the center of innovation (like 
IBM, Xerox, and Samsung). This trends continued with the recent imports, including Wal-Mart 
and Baidu research center. Other independent R&D centers spun out of university relationships, 
such as the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). In addition to providing the Valley with a deep 
reservoir of top technical talent, these centers spark new ventures as engineers and scientists seek 
entrepreneurial outlets for themselves and their projects. 
 
Service Providers and Management. The needs of large numbers of cash-starved, high-potential 
startups led to the development of specialized providers (such as lawyers, accountants, design 
professionals, recruiting firms, investment bankers, incubators, and accelerators) who not only 
provided tailored professional services, but also were willing to discount or defer fees, often in 
exchange for a small share in the venture’s eventual returns. Similarly, a professional 
entrepreneur management class evolved to enable the rapid scaling of young ventures. These 
managers are highly regarded individuals who specialize in working with startups of a certain size 
or stage where their functional expertise (i.e., product development, finance, engineering, sales, 
and marketing) is primary, with industry-specific experience secondary. 
 
Moore’s Law. A principal—and underlying—driver of technological innovation in the Silicon 
Valley and worldwide over the last 50 years has been the ever-increasing power of the computer 
microprocessor, a phenomenon that has now become known as Moore’s Law. Named for the cofounder of Intel who first observed this trend, Gordon Moore had predicted in 1965 that the 
calculating power of a computer microprocessor would double every 12 months for the next 10 
years. Ten years later his prediction had held true. Moore then forecasted in 1975 that the 
doubling would occur every two years for the next 10 years through 1985. In the late 1980s, 
Moore again estimated that this doubling would occur every two years for another decade.70 
Over a half-century, Moore’s Law still held true. (Exhibit C) This increased power of 
microprocessors over the last five decades has led to its evolution from integrated circuits to the 
personal computer, the internet and mobile devices, (Exhibit D) and the emergence of several 
innovative and disruptive high-tech companies. 
 
Which of these factors were important to Niantic’s eventual success? At what stages? Are they 
still important? Which may be most useful going forward? [e.g. Established tech incumbents? 
Early stage tech or game startups? VC firms?] Why? How would you structure to engage with 
them?
