          title: "AI as an Accelerator and Scaler",
          content: `Across all five stages of the DT process, AI emerged as both an accelerator and scaler, streamlining tasks and enabling faster iterations. Findings show dramatic speed improvements in data analysis, user research and MVP development, scaled through automation and large-scale data processing.

In the Empathize stage, AI semi-automates time-intensive discovery, enabling early customer understanding via sentiment analysis, review scraping, or simulated interviews. In the Define stage the faster synthesis of insights is evident when analyzing big amounts of collected data, using pattern recognition for identifying pain points, a time-intensive task previously done manually. Such automation aligns with Obschonka and Audretsch's (2020) claims of accelerated opportunity recognition and Verganti et al. (2020) emphasis on improved and more user centered approaches regarding empathy in early-stage innovation due to AI.

In the Ideation stage, a prompt-chain setup can compress the time frame, and AI's ability to take different roles supports developing solutions outside the original scope, a finding backed by Davidsson and Sufyan (2023). For Prototyping and Testing, no-code tools or programming AIs help build quick MVPs that can be tested by real people immediately, increasing the quality of the testing insights, leading to reduced cost and time, as well as more experimentation cycles and earlier market feedback.

The findings generally align with those of Chalmers et al. (2021) and Giuggioli and Pellegrini (2023), emphasizing AI's potential to scale entrepreneurship significantly and efficiently through AI-enabled approaches. However, some participants cautioned against over-relying on speed at the expense of depth, a point only briefly touched upon by Cautela et al. (2019).`

          title: "Impact on Creativity",
          content: `For the impact on creativity, the findings in the Ideation stage are of most interest. Interviewees voiced that AI stimulated ideation and served as a source of inspiration, supporting Figoli et al.'s (2022) view of AI as an early-stage collaborator in idea development. Boussioux et al. (2024) and Girotra et al. (2023) similarly share participants' view on AI's high-quality, valid output, which can be achieved by making use of AI's capabilities to take different roles or asking to challenge existing thinking.

While Boussioux et al. (2024) and Girotra et al. (2023), acknowledge the high quality and viability in AI ideas, both state that AI underperforms on novelty and originality, a theme that also emerged in the interviews. When tasked with originating ideas independently, AI often fails to produce contextually rich, surprising, or bold innovations, which are traits critical in entrepreneurship. This supports the view of Verganti et al. (2020), who argue that AI cannot replace the human in defining creative direction.

Interviewees found AI most useful as a creative companion that triggers human creativity rather than producing novel insights independently. The effectiveness of AI also seemed to depend heavily on how it was used, calling for prompting skills and human intervention. Boussioux et al. (2024) suggest assigning expert roles to AI to enhance output novelty to a more human-like level.`

          title: "Process-Wide Patterns and Implications",
          content: `AI both scales and compresses the time frame of each DT stage, reducing the overall cycle time. This supports and extends prior work on AI in entrepreneurship (Obschonka and Audretsch, 2020; Chalmers et al., 2021; Giuggioli and Pellegrini, 2023), particularly in terms of enhanced efficiency and the ability to explore broader problem spaces (Townsend and Hunt, 2019).

Importantly, AI not only reinforces the fluid movement between stages as previously noted by Verganti et al. (2020), but amplifies it, particularly between the "Empathize-Define" and "Prototype-Test" stages. This has resulted in more iterative, seamless transitions and continuous learning loops (Yu, 2025). A novel finding is the occasional skipping of stages (e.g. for direct MVP validation), something not addressed in existing literature and hinting at new behavior within the DT framework.

AI's dual role in creativity, both as a catalyst and as a constraint, becomes particularly evident in the Ideate stage. While using AI as an inspirational stimulus (Yu, 2025) and sparring partner evolves, the limitations in the originality of the output are apparent. The found data does not show a binary view that AI is either helpful or harmful to creativity by showing that its value is situational and only fully effective when paired with human intention, oversight, and refinement.`

          title: "Trust, Quality and Oversight",
          content: `Many participants expressed skepticism toward the output of AI when using it across stages of the DT process. While AI was widely appreciated as a productivity enhancer and thought stimulator, participants consistently emphasized that its outputs must be validated and contextualized by human judgment. This aligns with existing literature that positions AI as an augmentative force that requires technical refinement and oversight, rather than being fully autonomous (Chalmers et al., 2021).

This 'human-in-the-loop' was considered especially crucial to maintain reliability when AI outputs were used to inform important business directions or customer-facing decisions. Even when AI performed well, its lack of transparency caused discomfort, as outputs could not always be explained or traced, requiring additional validation. Shepherd and Majchrzak (2022) similarly state that this issue complicates accountability in decision-making processes.

Participants' concerns about quality control, leading to an increased risk of instability, was however contradicted by some literature. Figoli et al. (2022) described AI as a reliable teammate during early design stages, while the data complicates this description by showing that participants did not perceive reliability as an intrinsic component of current AI tools.`

          title: "Entrepreneurial Adaption to AI Complexity",
          content: `The growing complexity of the AI landscape created several challenges for participants. While they are actively adapting to ensure they are able to integrate AI effectively into their work, doing so requires a steep learning curve. Jeremiah (2025) adds to this by saying AI literacy is no longer just advantageous but becoming more and more essential when adopting AI, a sentiment echoed by many participants.

This challenge is amplified by the constant release of new tools, leading many users to only scratch the surface of AI's capabilities without fully understanding or leveraging them. This highlights a gap between availability and effective application. Building customized AI-driven workflows to fit specific venture-specific tasks is a way for participants to navigate this complexity with adaptive capability.

Obschonka et al. (2024) discuss the emerging role of entrepreneurs as prompt designers, shifting their role from creation to curation. The data extends that idea: prompt engineering and rich contextual input were mentioned as critical success factors, with many noting that an LLM's creative quality rises or falls with the precision of its prompts.`

          title: "Micro and Macro Impact",
          content: `Interviewees portrayed AI as a double-edged sword in their entrepreneurial lives. Aligning with research from Giuggioli and Pellegrini (2023) and Jeremiah (2025), widely accessible tools have accelerated productivity and enhanced individual capabilities, giving them a feeling of empowerment and tangible performance gains. On the other hand, in line with Samal et al.'s (2024) findings, the same accessibility has increased competition.

Obschonka et al. (2024) attribute this, in part, to the fact that AI has made prototyping available to everyone, no matter their experience, democratizing this previously challenging and time-consuming step. Yet AI's momentum has also created downsides, with most participants reporting growing dependency as their work becomes inseparable from it. Yu (2025) warns that cognitive overload and dependency on AI may hinder creativity and result in a passive mindset when engaging in entrepreneurial DT.

Participants were asked directly whether AI could be considered a co-founder. While they all acknowledged that it is incredibly useful for optimizing their workflow, none were fully convinced it could be seen as equal to a human co-founder. This reflects Davidsson and Sufyan (2023) research stating that AI lacks the intuition, contextual awareness, and risk-taking role critical to founding ventures.`

          id: "synthesis",
          title: "Synthesis: Challenges and Strategies",
          content: `At the center of this interplay is the persistent distrust in AI outputs. AI's "black-box" nature results for many in a concerning lack of trust and transparency, confining it to more of an advisory role. To bridge that trust gap, users have created a human-in-the-loop layer, constantly double-checking AI output with real customers or themselves.

Keeping up with the constant release of new AI tools only adds to the complexity. This learning curve makes AI literacy a new source of competitive differentiation: those who actively cultivate literacy, and master skills such as prompt designing and creating custom tools, move beyond generic outputs to venture-specific insights.

Furthermore, ventures have started creating their own AI policies and tools, and restructuring teams around smaller, AI-augmented cores. As employees deepen their understanding of AI, micro-level practice changes appear to accumulate into macro-level, organizational transformation. Entrepreneurial competition intensifies as a result of these individual and venture-level shifts. Because 'everyone is doing the same', presumed advantages are suddenly not advantageous anymore.`

      content: `After examining how AI affects activities in the DT process, the following can be said. Across all stages, speed and scale is dramatically increased. Individuals feel significantly empowered by being able to move faster, iterate more, and operate at a broader scope. However, these benefits are not without trade-offs. Challenges like limited creativity or trust issues quickly emerge when using AI without proper supervision. Individuals who use AI for entrepreneurial DT are very much aware of this, and therefore insist on human-AI collaboration, where human input, judgment, intuition, and strategic oversight remain critical for quality outcomes.

This collaboration becomes especially important as AI-generated outputs often lack depth and originality. However, when paired with human insight and used thoughtfully, AI can greatly enhance creativity, but this requires new skills. AI literacy, which encompasses strategic prompting, tool fluency, the ability to build custom workflows, and critical interpretation, is becoming a key differentiator in venture output and performance.

Where once adopting AI was a source of competitive advantage, it is now expected. The quality of usage, not just usage itself, has now become the new competitive edge. Overall, AI serves as a powerful tool for innovation through the augmentation of human capabilities, but meaningful outcomes only emerge when it is harnessed and steered by human involvement.`,
      keyInsight: {
        title: "Human-AI Collaboration Model",
        description: `In AI-driven DT, human involvement shifts across stages depending on the type of input each stage relies on. The stages Empathize, Ideate, and Test depend heavily on external human input. With AI, humans must stay directly involved to provide this input. AI can assist by processing data or generating prompts, but outputs require active validation, judgment, and creativity.

In contrast, the stages Define and Prototype rely on internally synthesized inputs. When using AI in these stages, humans are crucial for supervision. AI can help identify patterns or generate prototypes quickly, but humans provide the strategic oversight needed to ensure alignment with goals, feasibility, and quality.

DT is traditionally described as a human-centered approach to innovation. With the integration of AI, this is still the case. However, the meaning of "human-centered" has evolved. It no longer refers only to designing with the user in mind, but also to centering the human within the process for their creativity, ethical judgment, contextual understanding, technical expertise, and oversight necessary when working with AI.`,
