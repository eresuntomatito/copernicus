    title: "6.1 Concluding Summary",
    content: `Given the underexplored interaction between artificial intelligence (AI) and innovation methods like Design Thinking (DT) in entrepreneurship, this study was motivated by the need to examine their complex and evolving relationship, research especially called for by Cautela et al. (2019). It therefore explored how AI affects the activities involved in the DT process in entrepreneurship, and what challenges and strategies emerge in its practical application.

This study used a qualitative approach to explore the research topic, drawing insights from interviews with relevant individuals, and ultimately revealing five key dimensions that offer a structured understanding of the phenomena under investigation. Findings show that AI accelerates and scales activities across all stages, leading to a significant compression of the traditional DT cycle, by empowering individuals to work faster and more broadly. This supports and extends previous work by Cautela et al. (2019), Giuggioli and Pellegrini (2023) and Yu (2025), who found that AI enhances both efficiency and supports more informed and data-driven decision-making processes.

However, these advantages simultaneously come with several dangers: overall low trust in AI output, loss of depth in user understanding, reduced creativity, AI dependency, and the pressure of keeping up. Therefore, users actively position themselves in a participatory or supervisory role, depending on the stage, to ensure quality outcomes. In turn, this has led to the emergence of AI literacy as a new and essential skill. This evolving dynamic is illustrated in a visual model developed in this study, highlighting the shifting human-AI roles across the DT process.

As the field evolves, future research could investigate the robustness of these findings. In addition to the model, the study offers both theoretical implications and practical guidance on how to integrate AI in ways that enhance, rather than hurt, entrepreneurial outcomes.

Finally, circling back to the question posed at the beginning of this study – "Can AI serve as a co-founder in modern entrepreneurship?" – it concludes that the metaphor, while compelling in media and startup rhetoric, remains aspirational rather than operational.`

        description: "The scope and generalizability of the findings is limited by the qualitative methodology and the characteristics of the sample. With a total of nine participants, selected through purposive and convenience sampling, with similar geographical, industry and age background, the findings provide deep insights, but can not be statistically generalized to the broader population."
