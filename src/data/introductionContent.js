      content: `As artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes industries and redefines boundaries, for entrepreneurs, a provocative question arises: "Can AI serve as a co-founder in modern entrepreneurship?" This paper investigates this proposition, specifically exploring how AI interacts with and transforms the activities in the Design Thinking (DT) process within entrepreneurial context. The Fourth Industrial Revolution, enabling powerful computing and expanding AI's commercial applications, saw a pivotal acceleration with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 (OpenAI, 2022). The AI chatbot marks the beginning of widespread, consumer-ready access to AI tools for everyday tasks. So-called generative AI has democratized artificial intelligence, transforming it from a domain of complex algorithms accessible only to experts into an everyday tool (Gomstyn and Jonker, 2024). With its free, web-based availability, ChatGPT marked the beginning of mainstream AI's integration into everyday life, reaching 400 million active weekly users by February 2025 (Reuters, 2025).

With generative AI becoming increasingly integrated into society, the topic is gaining more prominence in news articles (Ryazanov et al., 2024), on social media platforms, as well as in scientific research (Ray, 2023). Some publications frame AI as a sparring partner for launching and growing businesses, like an article by Brown (2024) on the MIT Sloan School of Management website that takes the same approach, discussing the use of AI in a co-founder role and how generative AI is changing entrepreneurship. The possibility of using AI tools to handle various side tasks so that the entrepreneur can focus on his core competencies is the main idea of the article (Brown, 2024). AI can act as a guiding coach to the entrepreneur, helping to build and quickly validate businesses (Vecchiarini and Somià, 2023). This shift is driving a re-evaluation of the entrepreneurial process that promotes the rapid development of new ventures by enhancing agility and innovation while simultaneously making these capabilities more accessible. This emerging approach has been recognized in the scientific literature as the AI-enabled entrepreneurial process (Giuggioli and Pellegrini, 2023).

If new ventures effectively integrate AI into their day-to-day activities and leverage it as a core component of their business' growth, they will be able to be on the forefront of innovation (Samal et al., 2024). At the same time, DT has become a widely adopted approach in business creation, offering a much-needed framework to tackle uncertainty and problem-solving in entrepreneurship (Glen et al., 2014). It has proven to be especially useful for navigating ambiguity and developing innovative solutions in dynamic markets (Micheli et al., 2019). With its roots in human-centered innovation, DT emphasizes a practical approach to problem-solving through iterative experimentation and rapid learning (Brown, 2008), making it an ideal tool for entrepreneurs adapting to evolving customer needs. By fostering an empathetic understanding of users, the framework helps startups align their solutions with real-world demands, enabling faster, more reliable validation and more effective business strategies (Glen et al., 2014). With the emergence of AI as a tool for enhancing decision-making and problem-solving capabilities, important questions can be raised about its increasing impact on DT.

This evolving landscape raises a critical question: To what extent and in what ways can AI augment or affects the roles and activities traditionally performed by human (co-founders), especially with regard to the creative and strategic rigor required by processes such as Design Thinking? This study aims to shed light on these dynamics.`

      title: "1.2 Purpose of Study",
      content: `Despite the widespread recognition of AI's transformative potential and its growing use in entrepreneurship, the fundamental interaction between AI and innovation methods, such as DT, remains underexplored. This research does not focus solely on AI as an isolated technology or on DT in its traditional form. Rather, its relevance stems from the need to understand the emerging dynamics, tensions, and conceptual shifts that can arise at the intersection of these two different methods in entrepreneurship: one probabilistic and data-driven, and the other human-centered and abductive. This study is motivated by the unknowns emerging at the intersection of human and machine-led innovation. As AI continues to develop rapidly, its application to DT remains a new and emerging area, making it a compelling topic for further study. While DT excels in out-of-the-box thinking, caused by deep human empathy and creative divergence (Rösch et al., 2023), current generative AI excels at identifying patterns in large datasets and giving probable outputs (Fui-Hoon Nah et al., 2023). However, its dependence on existing knowledge may limit the potential for radical innovation that DT in entrepreneurship strives to foster, making its ability to co-create genuinely novel value uncertain.

Furthermore, the established stages of DT provide an iterative structure for innovation. AI's ability to rapidly process, synthesize, and generate information introduces the possibility of fundamentally altering this process. It is therefore interesting to research whether certain distinct stages begin to merge or become interconnected due to the impact of AI, which would reshape the architecture of the entrepreneurial DT process. Understanding the effect of AI's outputs on DT is especially compelling given that the true origin of the content is inherently unknown in AI's black-box design. This raises questions about how humans in the process deal with AI-generated insights, their own intuition and experience, and what strategies could emerge to amplify the process rather than constrain it.

Cautela et al. (2019) offer the only study directly examining the impact of AI on the DT process. The study raises concerns about the long-term impact on creative and strategic processes. It suggests that, while AI may accelerate certain stages, it shifts creativity from problem framing to solution generation, contradicting the core principles of DT (Cautela et al., 2019). The authors also warn that AI could replace human-centered validation throughout the process (Cautela et al., 2019). However, the study has limitations, including its reliance on secondary data and focus on well-funded startups, and it calls for further qualitative research to gain deeper insights into AI's real-world influence (Cautela et al., 2019).

Given the alignment between the entrepreneurial process and DT, the framework serves as a useful lens through which to examine the influence of AI on entrepreneurship. As many new ventures use this framework to improve problem solving, iteration, and innovation (Brown, 2008), investigating how AI interacts with each stage can provide insight into its real-world benefits and limitations. However, rapid AI advancements pose a risk of quickly outdating research in terms of the examined technology, underscoring the need for ongoing, up-to-date research that captures the evolving landscape and its implications. Therefore, this study is motivated by the urgent need to examine the complex and evolving relationship between AI and human-centric innovation methodologies in the entrepreneurial landscape.`

      title: "1.4 Research Question",
      content: `In order to fulfill the purpose of study and the research aim, the following research question will be investigated in this paper:

"How does artificial intelligence affect the activities involved in the design thinking process in entrepreneurship, and what challenges and strategies emerge in its practical application?"

This question explores how AI interacts with the activities that make up the different stages of the DT process as applied to entrepreneurship. These activities are explored additionally on speed and scale dimensions to analyze the impact of AI on each stage. Speed refers to the time and rate at which the users can progress through the activities of each stage of the DT process. Scale refers to the ability to expand solutions and ideas beyond small projects to reach larger audiences without proportionally increasing resources, while also managing the increased operational complexity that comes with it. It also refers to the range of opportunities and problems that can be explored and addressed, as well as the diversity of solutions. Additionally, the research question focuses on the challenges and strategies that emerge in the practical application of AI in entrepreneurship. Using the DT process to study entrepreneurship provides a clear, structured way to analyze the early stages of the entrepreneurial process.`
