Te strategic transformation of John Deere: Precision 
Agriculture, AI, and the Internet of Tings 
“I’m all for innovation, and I think John Deere is a helluva company, but they’re trying to be the 
Facebook of farming.”1 
Kevin Kenney, Agricultural Engineer 
February 2022 marked a very salient point in the history of one of the world’s oldest and storied brands in ag -
ricultural equipment manufacturing. John Deere had announced its Leap Ambitions, a distilled articulation of 
its desire to move farm equipment and its construction equipment business into the world of the future. Leap 
Ambitions were meant to align the goals of the company with its customers along three key tracks—namely en -
hancing economic value for customers, increasing productivity in their operations, and delivering environmental 
sustainability. By 2023 when John May presented the keynote address at the opening session of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the frst time an agricultural manufacturer had been given that honor, its aspirations were clear for all to see. John Deere wanted to lead the industry into the Fourth industrial revolution by embrac -
ing modern tools ranging from artifcial intelligence (AI), computer vision and machine learning (CVML), and big data analytics to deliver personalized care for every single plant that a farmer planted on every square inch of farmland so that the overall crop yield could be maximized. Te application of these modern tools promised a wide range of benefts such as reducing the cost of raising crops, more accurately predicting yields from every single inch of farmland under cultivation, reducing the negative environmental consequences of farming such as the overuse of fertilizers, and promoting sustainability of the agricultural ecosystem that had been witnessing serious economic and environmental challenges. 
Te transformational journey promised to be a rather challenging one for John Deere. In the external 
realm, it was evident that the competitors were also chasing down the very same path of precision agricul -
ture, and competition was intensifying. Te deployment of AI and ML-based tools required access to large volumes of data that had to be collected from equipment used by customers on their farms or construc -
tion projects. Tis raised concerns about data privacy and data ownership and farmers feared they could well be at the mercy of the equipment manufacturers in years to come and even become more exposed to powerful seed producers who could strike lucrative deals with the equipment manufacturers in exchange for farm-specifc yield and soil data. Lastly, the line of equipment embodying cutting-edge technologies required signifcantly higher capital costs for the buyers, and coming as it did in the wake of a challenging economic market for commodities, there were questions about viability. Proponents of small farms were especially skeptical about the AI-infuenced picture of mega-yields painted by manufacturers. Recent trends showed that many of the farmers were actually racing to buy older, used tractors with enough life left in them. Tey found the older tractors less complex, easier to repair, and far more afordable than the newer high-tech versions. In discussing the increasing attractiveness of older tractors, one expert observed, “Te idea of much faster, more efcient work is appealing to everyone, but the extremely high cost in cash and lost time of both purchase and repairs to these complex machines makes them just out of reach for anyone not part of the big corporate farm economy.”

Would John Deere be able to cobble together its early wins to lead the race in precision agriculture? Would 
the company be able to persuade farmers to invest in smart technologies, especially in commodity markets where margins were fckle? Would the AI value proposition resonate both with large and small farmers? Pulling of the

 massive transformation from big iron to smart iron would entail equivalent changes in mindsets, not only those 
of the buyers but also John Deere’s internal stakeholders as well.3 
Te new age in agriculture: From mechanization to artifcial intelligence 
Historically, agriculture had been the cornerstone of human civilization, providing sustenance and shaping economies for millennia. Although a critical necessity, the industry has witnessed enormous change over the course of history. Even in the modern era, with the advent of larger farms and more efcient farming methods, the industry has witnessed periodic upheavals that have accompanied changes ranging from the introduction of mechanization, application of inorganic fertilizers, the advent of genetically engineered seeds, and a host of other technologies that have ensured a steady increase in yields from farmland. Although the developed world has typically led the way into agriculture in the modern era, developing countries had also begun adopting these same advanced methods and technologies given the ever-increasing need for greater efciency and yield maxi -
mization that were vital in a commodity industry. Several of the bigger farm operators had even begun to pursue global ambitions by leveraging farmland across borders to grow crops, mostly animal feed, to help keep prices under check in their own vertical value chain for raising livestock. For example, a Saudi Arabian dairy farming company, Almarai, leased thousands of acres of farmland in Arizona and California where it grew alfalfa, a criti -
cal feed for cattle. Te alfalfa was then exported to its Saudi Arabian operations. Tis ensured that the company could grow cattle feed away from the constraints of limited access to water that characterized its home country. Daewoo Logistics, a South Korean company, had leased 1.3 million hectares of farmland in Madagascar, about half the size of Belgium, to grow cash crops for export to Seoul. Since South Korea had very limited arable land, this was considered to be one way of alleviating potential shortages in the future. Countries such as China, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and South Korea, all short of arable land, had been pursuing global vertical integration strategies for supply security. Despite such attempts, experts believed that this was unlikely to become a major trend given geopolitical complexities and challenging economics. Te focus on farm output yields and efciency seemed to ofer a better path toward self-sufciency for most countries. 
Te mechanization of agriculture, achieved through the deployment of machinery, had been a critical 
component for increasing crop production. As time progressed, it was universally acknowledged as a vital ele-ment for boosting productivity and ensuring sustainability.
4 Te incorporation of agricultural machinery not 
only refned existing farming techniques but also amplifed farm productivity, addressed labor shortages, and optimized land use for crop cultivation. With the global demand for food on the rise, there had been an escalating need for agricultural machines that were both efcient and environmentally friendly. Coupled with the advent of inorganic fertilizers, farmers were able to bring an elevated level of technological sophistication to operate very large farms in ways that were extremely efcient. Precision agriculture, a new way to manage farms and farm production, seemed to be on the rise. 
Precision agriculture was defned as a farm and crop management approach that accounted for “temporal 
and spatial variability to improve sustainability of agricultural production.”
5 In simple terms, this approach 
recognized the fact that there was signifcant variability both within and across farmlands, and therefore higher levels of customization of fertilizers and other inputs could maximize yield. Te personalization phenomenon that had swept consumer markets was taking over farmland as well. With demand for calories expected to grow by almost 50% over the next few decades, the challenge of increasing yields from currently available land was indeed a pressing one. 
Companies engaged in the precision agriculture industry brought to bear digital tools such as GPS to map 
individual farm holdings, and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) to layer specifc location and position data with other rich inputs such as fertilizer use, seed variety, moisture levels, etc. to create actionable, location-specifc records that farmers can use to aid their decision making. Combined with sensors, both in the ground and embed -
ded in farming equipment, these frms were able to leverage advances in IoT (Internet of Tings) technologies to relay real-time data to servers in the cloud, where algorithms and artifcial intelligence were deployed to assimilate and understand the data and recommend specifc courses of action that farmers could evaluate on the ground. Tis comprehensive data harvesting and analysis approach promised valuable advantages that weren’t accessible otherwise. For example, it was possible to develop fertilizer dosing recommendations at a micro level, where each plant or sapling would receive the right amount and kind of fertilizer that was customized to the needs of that specifc plant. Tis not only ensured signifcant savings in fertilizer costs but also signifcantly reduced fertilizer

  run-of and environmental contamination when farms were fertilized in aggregate rather than at the plant/sapling 
level. With the added beneft of continuous monitoring of plant growth, it was possible to predict with a great deal of precision the ideal time for harvest when the crops were ready for market. Important attributes such as the weather conditions, heat levels, and water tables were no longer subject to the vagaries of the Farmer’s Alma -
nac. Sensors on the ground combined with satellite data promised to monitor drought conditions, the onset of rains, incidence of weeds, and pests to ofer levels of reliable predictability that would minimize if not eliminate the role of intuition and guessing from the farming business. Realizing the full potential of precision agriculture required an entirely new ecosystem, one that was quite diferent from the traditional world that had character -
ized farming for several decades. (Exhibit 1 shows the diferent levels of autonomy targeted by farm equipment makers and Exhibit 2 shows the major competitors in the industry).

Te precision agriculture ecosystem encompassed a range of players both generalists and specialists with 
varying levels of engagement in the traditional world of farming. Te major players who formed part of the eco -
system included farm machinery and equipment manufacturers, GPS providers, GIS specialists, seed producers, 
fertilizer manufacturers, pesticide and chemical manufacturers, irrigation specialists, IoT technology companies, and artifcial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing providers. Te creation of value in this ecosystem required the orchestration of a seamless process where data could be collected from the farms and processed in real time, with resulting analyses and recommendations passed on to the farmer for action. Complex as that was, the end-user community presented some unique quirks of its own.

 Te average farmer in the U.S. was 58 years old and still largely relied on in-person advisory services 
when it came to making decisions about seeds, crops, yields, and fertilizers.6 Further, over 90% of farms in the 
country were classifed as small farms with gross cash income of $250,000 or less, according to the USDA.7 Te 
incidence of row farming, a prerequisite for leveraging the highest yields through precision agriculture, was still 
quite low—especially in smaller farms, which formed the majority of the agricultural belt not only in the U.S. but also globally. Agriculture had always been a notoriously low-margin business and farmers were typically reluctant to shoulder signifcant capital expenditure outlays when the benefts of such spending did not percolate to their bottom line within the shortest time window. McKinsey, the consulting company, reported that roughly 25% of the farmers in the U.S. were using precision agriculture management software and hardware and a mere 3% had expressed interest in adopting such tools in the near future, according to a survey that was completed by the company.
8 Te survey showed that the major impediments that constrained wider adoption were the high 
cost of equipment, relatively low willingness to pay (WTP), unclear returns from the investment, and a fairly steep expectation of profts that farmers desired (~3X). Penetration rates in Europe mirrored the U.S., although adoption in Asia and Latin America was well behind. However, the adoption cycles of most new technologies followed similar patterns and the companies engaged in the industry were hopeful that they would be able to drive up adoption rates in those regions in due course. Te benefts ofered by precision agriculture would be a huge carrot, in their opinion. 
Experts in precision agriculture at the U.S. Department of Agriculture had identifed several tangible advan -
tages associated with the adoption of precision agriculture, or what they referred to as site-specifc management (SSM). For example, they had suggested that the adoption of auto-steer technology (GPS-guided control of tractors and farm equipment) could result in a savings of 20% because the technology ofered “accuracy within one centimeter when planting, spraying herbicide, or applying fertilizer….[which results] in fewer overlaps (areas in the feld with double application) and gaps (or skipped areas in the feld) and overall improved efciencies (both economic and environmental).”
9 Te adoption of auto-steer or tractor guidance technology would however 
require the farm to use row farming. Similar gains were also possible if farmers were willing to use variable rate technology, an approach that customized the amount of fertilizer, nutrients, and water to site-specifc soil and plant needs, thus eliminating waste and fertilizer runof. A large number of new ventures had emerged to pursue this opportunity in farming both in the U.S. as well as global markets. Globally, over 700 agriculture technol-ogy startups raised $10.65 billion in 2022, with a signifcant proportion of them targeting precision agriculture opportunities in controlled climate systems and climate monitoring.

Although the emergence of the new ecosystem in precision agriculture had encompassed many new entrants 
from distinct industry sectors such as satellite imagery and artifcial intelligence, the agricultural machinery 
manufacturers formed an important hub given their long engagement in the industry alongside the fertilizer producers and the seed stock providers. Terefore, it was not surprising that some among them saw themselves

sion agriculture ecosystem). 
Te agricultural machinery market had been dominated by several key players, including Deere and Co. 
(John Deere), CNH Industrial, AGCO Corporation, Kubota, Mahindra, and Mahindra Limited, Iseki & Co. 
Ltd, and JC Bamford Excavators.11 Of these frms, John Deere was by far the largest and had roughly twice the 
revenues of the second-place company, CNH Industrial, a Dutch corporation12, and it had launched a major 
strategic initiative to claim a top spot in the precision agriculture industry. 
John Deere: Te journey from the steel plow to autonomous tractors and beyond 
Te agricultural machinery industry had witnessed numerous innovations over the years, but few left as indelible a mark as John Deere. Founded in the heartland of America, the company’s story began in 1837 with a simple yet groundbreaking invention by John Deere, a skilled blacksmith. Recognizing the challenges faced by farmers in the Midwest, particularly with the sticky soil that rendered iron plows inefective, Deere introduced the frst commercially successful self-scouring steel plow. Tis invention was not just a product; it was a testament to Deere’s commitment to solving real-world problems and improving agricultural efciency. 
In search of better prospects, Deere relocated to Grand Detour, Illinois, in 1836. It was in this new setting, 
amidst the vast expanses of fertile land, that he identifed a pressing need for a more efcient plowing solution. His steel plow not only addressed this need but also laid the foundation for a company that would, in time, become synonymous with agricultural machinery worldwide. 
As the decades unfolded, Deere & Company, under the leadership of its founder and subsequent genera -
tions, expanded its horizons. From its initial focus on plows, the company ventured into producing a diverse range of machinery, each designed to cater to specifc farming needs. T ractors, harvesters, and balers were just a few of the many innovations that bore the iconic John Deere emblem. Beyond farming, the company also made signifcant inroads into the construction and forestry sectors, further solidifying its position as a global industrial powerhouse.
13 
It was 185 years after its founding that Deere CEO John May premiered a fully autonomous tractor at the 
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Te tractor was built on Deere’s *R chassis, outftted with six pairs of stereo cameras that ofered it 360-degree obstacle detection as its computers used a neural network to process and classify the images to detect impediments along the way. It was equipped with GPS tracking that allowed it to plow along neat rows of soil in preparation for cultivation. It could also be ftted with spray booms equipped with 36 cameras that were programmed to identify weeds that needed to be sprayed with herbicide that was delivered by the booms. All a farmer had to do was bring the tractor to the farm, use a mobile app to set the farm parameters, and then swipe right to get the tractor to start operating autonomously. Te farmer could then leave the feld to

 attend to the rest of the day while checking in on the tractor remotely through the app.14 Tis represented Level 
5 automation, industry parlance for the highest level of autonomy that was achievable where the machine could 
perform all the functions that a human could. See Exhibit 1 for a description of the levels of autonomy. 
Te autonomous tractor was an integral part of the Leap Ambitions strategy that Deere had set in motion 
to strategically transform the company from its big iron roots to a digitally enabled, AI-savvy player that could lay claim to a pride of place in the precision agriculture pantheon. Te new vision, strategy, and operating model were designed “to unlock new value for customers and respond more quickly to changing market conditions” and “accelerate its success in the integration of smart technology innovation with Deere’s legacy of manufactur-ing excellence.”
15 Te company described the core strategy as consisting of three interrelated parts —a focus on 
leveraging technology that would help design machinery that was smarter, precise, and more productive; building on long-standing expertise in manufacturing to design production systems that would help align products and solutions to deliver higher value and efciency for customers; and emphasizing the life cycle value added of the machinery and equipment with an eye toward reducing downtime and costs while increasing productivity. In simple terms, the company promised to bring an intensive technology orientation to improve customer value across the board from equipment to solutions. 
Implementing the Leap Ambitions Strategy 
Te Leap Ambitions strategy hoped to digitally engage at least 50% of farmers worldwide by 2026, connecting 
over 500 million acres of farmland to its digital framework, and ensuring that 100% of all equipment sold to small agriculture and turf management frms was digitally connected. Te company felt that this was not as revolutionary a process as it appeared from the outside. Rather, it felt that this was representative of actions that the company had embarked upon over the last two decades with the gradual introduction of new systems and initiatives ranging from programs such as AutoT rac and ExactApply, which had already been embraced by its customers. In fnancial terms, the company expected to generate 10% of its overall revenues from software and subscriptions by 2030. Tat was indeed a lucrative prospect since software carried a gross margin of 85% compared to the relatively low margins of 25% generated by equipment sales. Emblematic of this desire, Deere employed more software engineers than mechanical engineers, an evocative testament to the transformation of the company from its big iron roots to a more nimble, futuristic competitor with the ability to harness multiple technologies in the pursuit of delivering value. 
Te path to the future had started in the decade of the 1990s, when a group of engineers was split of from 
their product line jobs in tractors and combines to move to Des Moines, Iowa, where Deere wanted them to work on integrating GPS technology into its tractors. Refecting on those early years, Julian Sanchez, Director of Emerging Technology at Deere, observed “Te economics of accuracy are easy to understand because you overlap less.”
16 Tis represented huge savings in terms of areas on the farm that inadvertently got left out from fertilizing 
or planting or got more than one dose of what was required. At this stage in the evolution, Deere was emphasizing its own internal innovation abilities to power its strategies in precision agriculture. It developed the GreenStar yield mapping system for mapping the felds where its equipment was in use and the JD Link telematics system for connecting feld-level data to a centralized data repository for further processing and analysis. However, it realized that the race to gain its rightful place in the emerging feld of precision agriculture required the frm to rethink its approach to partnerships and collaborations. In-house abilities in GPS navigation were bolstered by the strategic acquisition of Navcom, a California company that specialized in satellite-based navigation systems and processing of precise location data. Deere had been working with Navcom to design its GPS tractors well before it decided to acquire the company. 
Te next big leap came when Deere incorporated geospatial abilities in its equipment using sensors. Recall-
ing the pivotal advance, Sanchez said, “Every kind of agronomic work, whether it’s putting a seed in the ground or harvesting a plant or applying herbicides, has a sensor associated with it, so we know what is working well in the feld and what is not.”
17 Tis led to Deere being able to develop detailed and granular maps of a farmer’s 
land with a level of layered data encompassing a very broad spectrum of parameters, such as moisture levels, soil nutrients, seeds compatibility, and temperature. After initially collecting sensor data via a USB device on board the tractor, the company switched to using the cloud and deployed IoT sensors. Te company had partnered with several premier universities to advance the application of robotics and had begun eyeing opportunities in artifcial intelligence fairly early in the game. Much of the company’s AI capabilities were built on acquisitions.

 In 2017, Deere acquired Blue River Technologies, a machine learning company that had signifcant ex-
pertise in AI and deep learning, for $305 million. It had developed a machine vision technology that, when 
deployed in conjunction with AI and machine learning abilities, could process images of felds in real time and identify plants from weeds. Tis was then integrated into sprayers that could spray herbicides accordingly. Tis ability to move pesticide and fertilizer application from the feld level to the plant level was an enormous leap that promised signifcant cost savings and environmental benefts as well. Te move toward a plant-specifc focus represented an important infection point in the industry. Tis combination of equipment-based technologies with machine learning and AI formed the backbone of precision agriculture. Tis allowed the farmer to collect data on the ideal spot for planting a kernel of corn in the feld based on data collected from sensors that ofered a rich picture of moisture level, soil and nutrient quality, level of sunshine, and proximity to other plants that compete for nutrients, all of which could help identify the specifc spot where the yield from the plant could be optimized. Te future, however, was yet to dawn because some of these technologies, such as real-time nutrient monitoring, had not yet been understood well enough to calibrate without the need for extensive of-site analysis and human intervention. As Sanchez observed, “It’s really hard to measure things like nitrogen, potassium, or sodium in real-time in a reliable way. Today, someone goes out to the feld, sticks a tube in the ground, takes a core sample, sends it to a lab, and six weeks later you get a result.”
18 
Deere had continued its spate of acquisitions, seeking to develop scale in its quest for digitally transform-
ing itself and its industry. In 2021 it acquired Bear Flag Robotics, a California company specializing in robotics and autonomous driving technologies. Bear Flag’s robotics expertise was expected to dovetail with Deere’s own autonomous tractor eforts and hasten the development of a higher level of automation and autonomy that it felt would be attractive to farmers. Jahmy Hindman, the CTO of Deere, speaking about the acquisition, said “Deere views autonomy as an important step forward in enabling farmers to leverage their resources strategically to feed the world and create more sustainable and proftable operations.”
19 Similar to its Navcom and Blue River 
acquisitions, Deere had been working with Bear Flag for a few years before deciding to acquire the company for $250 million. In 2023, John Deere acquired SparkAI, a New York-based startup known for its human-in-the-loop technology designed to assist robots in resolving edge cases in real time. Prior to the acquisition, John Deere had been a customer of SparkAI for several years. In situations where the autonomous tractor faced navigational uncertainty, it would automatically contact SparkAI’s service. Te service would then combine cognitive input from human specialists and results from its software-based decision system to provide a resolution. Tis resolu -
tion would then be used by the tractor to make a safe and informed decision. Te entire process was swift, taking only seconds and occurring thousands of times daily.
20 In 2023, Deere also acquired a precision air-blast spraying 
company, Smart Apply, to fortify its ability to deliver chemicals required in tree cultivation using LiDAR tech -
nology. It had worked with the company for several years before the acquisition. Te company relied mostly on in-house applications development expertise but also allowed 184 companies to connect to the Deere Operations Center, the central data hub, through encrypted APIs (Application Programming Interface) so that they could develop and test applications for the beneft of farmers who could buy their applications independently, a version of Apple’s App store for farmers. Almost all transactions between the company and its farmer community were mediated by a central web interface, MyJohnDeere.com. From its early start as a platform for both Deere and third-party purveyors ofering sensors, weather data, agronomics data, software applications, and even competitor equipment, the site ofered a one-stop shop for all the farmer’s needs. It allowed the farmer to see data relating to their own felds, equipment use and warranty history, location of their equipment and usage details, repair statistics, spare parts ordering, and a whole host of other services. 
While acquisitions bolstered John Deere’s technological capabilities, the company also faced challenges along 
the way. Te integration of new technologies and startups into the company’s existing infrastructure required careful planning and execution. Moreover, the agricultural machinery industry was highly competitive, with other players also making strategic acquisitions and investments. John Deere had to ensure that its acquisitions added value to its product line and resonated with its customer base. Te initial reports from customers were less sanguine than originally expected. 
Deere had faced headwinds from farmers who had accused the company of developing proprietary software 
and hardware that made their equipment difcult to repair at facilities outside the Deere network. With the stated intent of connecting 1.5 million pieces of equipment in service and over 500 million hectares of connected farmland in its customer network, Deere had plans of centralizing its data operations where it would collect, store, and analyze data from customer farms. However, the ownership of the data from a specifc farm was not

 clear. Would the farmer have sole access? Would Deere retain all such access? Tis concern surfaced in many 
conversations with customers. For example, the Wall Street Journal interviewed Walter Schweitzer, the president of the Montana Farmers Union, who said “You’re losing control of the data, and the ownership of the tools,” and he therefore worried that the company could have a greater level of infuence over the farmer’s operations while at the same time collecting data from the farm for the company’s own beneft.
21 For example, the equipment 
manufacturers could share farm data with seed companies, competing farmers, or other agribusiness services, all of which would result in loss of control and/or higher prices for the farmer. As one farmer remarked, “Tere’s a lot of value to that information. I’m afraid, as farmers, we are not going to be the ones reaping the beneft.”
22 
Deere was hoping to sell a subscription service to farmers that would help them access research and recom -
mendations from Deere’s AI system. It was considering selling software as a service and charging a fat fee per acre where its software was deployed. Te catch, however, was that farmers would have to buy the latest Deere equipment to use the service. Te right to repair had emerged as a formidable issue. Farmers complained that the equipment was too expensive and could be serviced only by Deere technicians, often entailing long wait times and lost productivity for the farmer. With increasing technological sophistication, the cost of farm equipment had begun to skyrocket, placing some of the more advanced models out of reach of the small farmers who could not aford such outlays. 
A host of other players, such as BlueWhite from Israel, already ofered a subscription-based turnkey au -
tonomy option that used a common digital architecture with retrofts of existing equipment to keep capital costs low. Te company had reported 35% to 75% cost reductions in some of the farms that it served.
23 Another Deere 
competitor, AGCO, had chosen to focus more on the retroftting path to precision agriculture. “Retroftting is a key part of how we operate our Precision Planting brand and not many others do that. We know farmers’ disposable income is limited and how they can invest is limited. We try to create solutions in a very scalable manner. If they wish to retroft a planter, they don’t need to retroft the entire machine. Tey upgrade a section at a time to enhance functionality and performance without going fully to robot remote control.”
24 Studies had 
shown that tractors and other heavy farm equipment spend 50% of the time on roads and highways going from feld to feld, limiting their productive use to around 150-200 hours per year.
25 Farming as a service had become 
increasingly popular and companies were ofering the service as a part of a retroftted equipment package. One such player, Sabanto, was retroftting Deere competitor Kubota’s, tractors for around $100,000 with an annual service subscription for $2,000-$2,500. Te tractor was capable of operating 24/7. Tis contrasted with some of the more established players like Deere, who seemed to focus on equipment that was priced as much as fve times the Sabanto ofering. 
Te farmers were also a bit unsure about the value of all the data that the new AI-equipped tractors and 
farm equipment collected and analyzed. One farmer observed, “We’re collecting so much data that you’re almost paralyzed with having to analyze it all. When I’m planting my cornfeld, I can tell you how well the spacing is from seed to seed just from sitting in the cab, but I don’t think that we’ve actually tapped into all of the informa -
tion we can garner.”
26 Te customer experience was not as seamless as promised and it often took a long time 
to overcome software slowdowns, navigate difcult interfaces, and interpret dense analytics. Although most farms deployed diferent pieces of equipment, often sold by specialized providers, each gathering its own set of data relating to a specifc slice of the farm’s operations, there was no easy way to integrate the data streams to provide a comprehensive look at decisions and outcomes at the farm level. Amazon and Google were eyeing this opportunity and Amazon’s AWS had partnered with Leaf, a startup that was providing software connectors between data sources in diferent formats. Google had partnered with Agrology, a startup to process data and predict microclimates within farms, and Mineral, a venture that was building a data analysis platform that would aggregate data for the application of AI tools that would result in farm-level recommendations. 
Maintaining Momentum and Selling the Value 
While the road had been fraught with challenges, the potential benefts of precision agriculture were undeniable. John Deere’s transition from “big iron” to “smart iron” not only required technological advancements but also a shift in mindset among all stakeholders. Could the company continue to strike a balance between innovation and tradition, ensuring that the benefts of technology were accessible to all, from large-scale corporate farms to smallholders?

 Te external competitive landscape had been rapidly evolving, with other players also venturing into preci -
sion agriculture. Te deployment of AI and ML tools necessitated access to vast amounts of data, raising concerns 
about data privacy, ownership, and potential monopolization by equipment manufacturers. Furthermore, the high capital costs of advanced equipment, especially in a volatile commodity market, posed questions about its viability, especially for small farms. Te age demographic of the average farmer and their reliance on traditional methods further complicated the adoption of these new technologies. 
On the other hand, the opportunities were immense. Te promise of precision agriculture wasn’t just about 
increasing yields but also about promoting sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of farming. Te potential to deliver personalized care for every plant could revolutionize farming, making it more efcient and environmentally friendly. Moreover, the integration of various technologies, from AI to IoT, could provide farm -
ers with real-time insights, enabling them to make informed decisions. John Deere’s vision, as part of its “ Leap 
Ambitions,” to digitally connect a signifcant portion of the world’s farmland by 2026 showcased the company’s commitment to leading this transformation. Despite Deere’s ambitions, would farmers long for simpler and less costly solutions? How could the company shape its value propositions as it assertively bundled AI-driven preci -
sion farming with the sale of its farm equipment? And would the company be able to successfully orchestrate the growing ecosystem of technology providers required to achieve precision farming?
